The way the slightly overweight feminist apologetically paused, fought back tears, and forced out a simple, \u201cStuff happened there,\u201d told the story of the pain she\u2019s been carrying since she first started fighting for gender equality almost two years ago.\n\nBradley\u2019s troubles reached an apex the day she organized an anti-Donald Trump rally in Lubbock, Texas. Prudence and a group of fellow UW-M students made the long trek from Madison, WI, to protest Trump\u2019s treatment of women in the Lone Star State.\n\nAlmost an hour into their protest, a man wearing a Make America Great Again hat and confederate flag suspenders approached her and screamed \u201cfeminazi f*ck pig\u201d right to her face. For Mrs. Bradley, it was like being shot point blank in the face with a high-capacity assault weapon.\n\n\u201cI was in a state of total shock,\u201d said Bradley, \u201cI couldn\u2019t feel my legs and thought I may have been paralyzed.\u201d After being treated at a local medical facility for minor emotional distress, Prudence caught the first flight back home to seek a second opinion.\n\n\u201cPrudence was showing all the classic symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD,\u201d said Dr. Liam Williams, Bradley\u2019s family doctor in Madison. \u201cRe-experiencing the trauma through intrusive and distressing recollections of the event, flashbacks, and nightmares are just some of Mrs. Bradley\u2019s symptoms,\u201d warned the doctor. \u201cPrudence was also showing extreme emotional numbness that puts her in a very dangerous category of PTSD. It\u2019s very important she start a treatment program immediately.\u201d\n\nThe Bradley family researched treatment facilities across the country, hoping to find a program that would give their daughter the best overall chance at a full recovery. After almost a month of searching, the family were losing hope until an email from a wounded slacktivist suggested they call the Wounded Social Justice Warrior Project\u00ae in Portland, Oregon.\n\nThe program provides personalized care, services, and advocacy to seriously wounded social justice warriors\u2014including those who have suffered post traumatic stress disorder and other medical health conditions.\n\nBesides adaptive and rehabilitative programs and caregiver support, the WSJWP also provides mentorship to recovering activists, an employment and career readiness program, and financial assistance for those who have suffered or aggravated an injury or illness and need help with daily living activities so they can avoid being hospitalized or put in an outpatient care facility.\n\nFor Prudence, the WSJWP has been a blessing. After a difficult and challenging three months in the program, Mrs. Bradley is starting to feel whole again, and is even looking forward to rejoining her fellow moonbats in time to protest the Republican National Convention next month in Jacksonville.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back,\u201d said Mrs. Bradley with a new found sense of confidence. \u201cI refuse to let these misogynists have the last laugh. This time I\u2019ll be ready for them.\u201d Prudence praises the WSJWP for giving her a second chance, not only at life, but a new sense of purpose to fight for social and economic justice. \u201cThis is my passion and I will never give up, ever.\u201d\n\nAbout the Wounded Social Justice Warrior Project\u00ae\n\nThe mission of the Wounded Social Justice Warrior Project\u00ae is to honor and empower our wounded heroes. Its purpose is to raise awareness of injured social activists, to help find them aid, and to provide unique, direct programs and services to help them continue with their activism.

I think the American people are smarter than that,\u201d Conway said.\n\nStudies have shown that almost one in five African Americans smoke menthol cigarettes, almost three times the rate of whites.\n\nFederal courts have time and again struck down sensible voter ID laws, concluding that minority voters are less likely to own a car and therefore less likely to obtain a driver\u2019s license that could be used as an acceptable form of ID.\n\n\u201cNow that is racist\u2026and total hogwash,\u201d says former Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker. \u201cIf these people can\u2019t obtain an ID then how are they buying all those menthol cigarettes they love so much?

The study found that gang violence was 16 times more likely to occur within a 5-mile radius of what the institute called \u201cMenthol Center Zones.\u201d The Menthol Menace concluded that polling stations within these \u201cMenthol Center Zones\u201d are likely to attract the highest concentration of fraudulent voters and should be heavily monitored on election day.\n\n[adsforwp id=\"70836\"]", "link": "https://nationalreport.net/trump-university-study-finds-correlation-between-menthol-cigarettes-and-voter-fraud/", "published": "2020-07-19T11:40:10+00:00"}, {"title": "Trump Administration to Launch \"Black Beans Matter\" Campaign - National Report", "text": "<Washington, DC>The Trump Administration has launched a \u201cBlack Beans Matter\u201d (\u201cFrijoles Negros Importan\u201d) campaign in support of a Goya Foods whose top executive was criticized last week for supporting President Trump.

Similar to the traditional Mardi Gras King\u2019s cake, in which a small coin or figure of baby Jesus is hidden inside, we recommend you hide something small or unexpected inside of at least one of the main dishes or desserts. Staff picks include a set of false teeth submerged in Great Aunt Muriel\u2019s homemade cherry cheesecake, or a modest bag of mixed prescription medication concealed in the mashed potatoes.\n\nOnce these unanticipated objects have been discovered, announce the finder as the subject of a brutal holiday roast! This game is a hilarious idea for all-inclusive entertainment, as everyone can criticize and berate the winner under the pretense of light-hearted ribbing, providing hours of amusement, and an acceptable excuse to dish out both emotional abuse, while creating fond memories for years to come.\n\nTruth Or Dare\n\nDo you suspect your family and/or friends are holding out on some dark secrets or privy to juicy need-to-know gossip? Well, there\u2019s no better way to really know your loved ones more intimately than to play an alcohol-fueled variant of truth or dare, also known as Spin the Bottle! If alcohol may not be effective for the family that already regularly drinks together, just use the CIA\u2019s favorite truth serum, Scopolamine, and spike their drinks.\n\nOf course, children must be excluded from this game due to its adult themes, so I suggested you shut them away in a distant room as to prevent any trauma due to all the familial skeletons figuratively pouring out of the closet. Who knew that Aunt Terri actually DID get rid of Uncle Berry for his $100,000 life insurance policy, and that he wasn\u2019t simply a victim of an unfortunate, and unsolved hit-and-run accident? You never know what you might learn about your family\u2019s history!\n\nOutdoor Scavenger Hunt\n\nLike most Thanksgiving celebrations, it is likely your guests have had at least two other meals under their belt before the main event. Consequently, in order to work up a genuine appetite for your Thanksgiving spread, have them embark on a harrowing scavenger hunt through a rented corn maze! (The bigger, the better.) Not only will it make them feel genuinely thankful for all the work you\u2019ve done to host this holiday event but also provide you with enough time to actually finish the cooking!\n\nProvide your party with a flare gun and a small flashlight in case they get lost in the maze, or are unable to understand the clues you\u2019ve dispersed randomly around the cornfield. That way they can find each other, and hopefully signal for help as darkness falls. The first ones out of the maze get to have the initial choice of their favorite foods, while the last to finish have to wash all the dishes, providing them with plenty of incentive to participate!\n\nCosplay\n\nOur next suggestion is to recreate an authentic Thanksgiving holiday by cosplaying as your favorite pilgrims from the Mayflower, complete with costumes and a vastly limited spread of food reminiscent of a meager Paleolithic diet. Hire real Native Americans to sit alongside your family and eat with you, just as they had with the pilgrims!\n\nKeep it traditional by trading them in dried corn, glass beads, and firewater for their service, and insist that they too attend the meal in historically accurate attire, such as leather loincloths, feathered headbands and a necklace of real human scalps.\n\nInvite The Homeless\n\nTurn your house into a surprise soup kitchen for the disenfranchised and unfortunate without informing your guests before they arrive!\n\nBefore turning your homestead into an impromptu food trough for the poor and downtrodden, it is highly recommended that you put up chicken wire to prevent them from getting into undesirable areas, such as your organic tomato garden, underwear drawer or medicine cabinet.\n\nThanksgiving is full of human-interest pieces and Facebook images about selfless individuals providing hot meals to the needy on a day known for generosity and goodwill. Bring this instant karmic good luck to you and all your loved ones by getting them unknowingly involved with your philanthropic endeavors. Put them on the spot as they are surrounded by shambling drug addicts and the streams of urine left in their wake. They will not be able to refuse an opportunity to brag about their charitable and selfless holiday on the nearest social media platform, especially before starting their Black Friday binge shopping!\n\n[adsforwp id=\"70836\"]", "link": "https://nationalreport.net/5-great-ways-entertain-guests-thanksgiving-celebration/", "published": "2017-11-23T15:00:30+00:00"}, {"title": "Study Claims Women Abandon Feminism After Finding Meaningful Relationships With Men - National Report", "text": "Women who remain die-hard feminists well into adulthood are oftentimes the least desirable specimens, science now claims.\n\n\u201cThe only relationships they have are often ones with other females who subscribe to the same strict ideologies, and serve as echo chambers for extremist thought. The stereotype of overweight, unattractive, bitter, resentful hags with a chip on their shoulder isn\u2019t really too far from the truth,\u201d said Sheila Baker, director of the Garrison Institute located in Langford, Mississippi.\n\n\u201cWomen who quickly abandon feminism are just happier in the long run,\u201d Harman told National Report. \u201cOnce they engage in a healthy relationship with a member of the opposite sex, 78% of women realize that they had been brainwashed via college campuses and social media. They\u2019re ashamed of having associated with a mob of mentally-ill whiners and seek to distance themselves from that lifestyle as much as possible.\u201d\n\nAfter graduating high school, Sheila Baker was accepted into at a well-known liberal college located in the Pacific Northwest, attended primarily by the offspring of affluent families. Even then, feminism was the social justice \u2019cause du jour\u2019 amongst bleeding-heart upper class young adults with no worldly perspective or experience. \u201cIt\u2019s true. I identified as a feminist in college,\u201d Baker blushingly confessed. \u201cIt\u2019s really rather embarrassing to admit now. I marched in the marches. I blogged with the best of them. I was full of entitlement and resentment towards what I thought at the time was the source of all the world\u2019s ills: The Patriarchy. In particular, white males. The only real exposure I had to the less fortunate was through my textbooks. Instructors basically fanned the flames by telling us that all sources of oppression and strife within\u2019 the world were due to privileged Caucasians.\n\nYou get a bunch of impressionable white kids together who are in a rebellious frame of mind and tell them that the families they grew up with are basically responsible for everything that is wrong with the world and I can guarantee the outcome is not going to be a healthy one.\u201d\n\nAnd the horror stories don\u2019t stop there says Sheila, who claims she has heard thousands of stories which ring similarly to her own. And far too many of those tales result in permanent damage to the woman, her personal life, and familial relationships.\n\nBarker went on to elaborate upon one particular instance in which a woman became so wrapped up in feminism that she was disowned by her family, eventually leading to her untimely demise at the hands of an intentional overdose.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll call this woman K.C. out of respect,\u201d Sheila began. \u201cWe were close friends in college, and even by my own admittedly very liberal standards, she was quite extreme.

The Washington Post broke the story stating the then 32 year-old Moore pursued a sexual relationship with Leigh Corfman outside a courtroom in Etowah County, Alabama in 1979.\n\nThe allegation, which includes 3 additional women between the ages of 16 and 18 and is supported by as many as 30 sources, sent shockwaves through the Republican Party forcing many high-ranking officials to respond on the record. Discussion quickly turned to the possibility of replacing Moore on the ballot, however Alabama law prohibits the replacement of a party candidate up to 76 days before the election.\n\nDan Stevens, a spokesman for the Alabama secretary of state\u2019s office told National Report Thursday the role of Moore will instead be played by actor Christopher Plummer. Plummer recently became a hot Hollywood commodity after he was chosen to replace another alleged pedophile, Kevin Spacey, in the upcoming file \u201cAll the Money in the World.\u201d He can, however, get all the money in the world by reading National Debt Relief reviews and more. It may not give him all the money in the world, but it sure is a great resource to help consolidate debt that can afford you more financial freedom.\n\nMoore has denied the allegations and has taken to social media to blame the mainstream media, along with the \u201cNational Democratic Party\u201d for what he considers to be a smear campaign.\n\nNational Report reached out to representatives for Mr. Plummer, but no response was received prior to publication.\n\n[adsforwp id=\"70836\"]", "link": "https://nationalreport.net/christopher-plummer-to-play-role-of-roy-moore-in-alabama-senate-race/", "published": "2017-11-09T21:09:50+00:00"}, {"title": "35-Year-Old Man Sues His Mother After Being Evicted From Basement Of Her Home", "text": "Duane Hollingsworth shuffles around the cramped confines of his temporary home\u2013a tiny 5th wheel trailer filled with boxes containing clothes, personal effects, and other meager belongings. After spending his entire life dwelling in the basement of his mother\u2019s home, she had finally become fed up with her unmotivated son and gave Hollingsworth the boot.\n\nThe unemployed 35-year-old who has never lived on his own was clearly distressed when I spoke with him Wednesday. \u201cShe\u2019s destroyed my life\u201d, he exclaimed bitterly, staring at the photo in his clenched fist; A photograph of his family during happier times.\n\nDuane has 3 younger siblings who have since gone on with their lives and become successful, driven adults, but Duane\u2019s life just never seemed to take off. He remained content with frittering away his days playing video games and watching anime cartoons; Things that are mostly enjoyed by children. Duane is an adult male who just absolutely refuses to grow up.\n\nAfter the death of Duane\u2019s father 2 years ago, his mother Janice gave him an ultimatum: Either get a full-time job, enroll in college, or find somewhere else to live. After a handful of paltry attempts to secure employment at various fast-food establishments, it was clear that Duane would rather spend his time nestled among My Little Pony figurines in a musky basement than actually work for a living.\n\n\u201cIt was clear he wasn\u2019t serious about making a living for himself\u201d, Janice explained. \u201cHe always had some excuse and frankly all these excuses were wearing very thin. I just wanted him out so I could enjoy retirement after having lost my husband. He was becoming an enormous financial burden and didn\u2019t seem to care. Duane wouldn\u2019t budge. He would frequently lash out and blame his siblings and myself for his lot in life.\u201d\n\nEventually the moment of reckoning finally arrived in January of this year. Janice gave Duane 30 days to find somewhere else to live. \u201cIt was 30 days of pure hell. He stormed around the house screaming and crying. I could not believe what a spoiled brat he was at 35 years years of age! He always resented me for having more children after he was born. I suppose he just thought he would be the baby forever, but that clearly is not a healthy way for an adult to live.\u201d\n\nDuane finally found a tiny trailer for rent on the outskirts of town. He is currently supporting himself by selling off his vintage action figures and other collectibles on Ebay. He has also began taking steps to sue his own mother for damages, pain and suffering, emotional trauma and illegal eviction, all to the tune of 750k.\n\n\u201cI have PTSD now\u201d, he exclaimed during our short interview. Duane sat across from me looking distressed and disheveled, wearing grimy gray sweatpants and a threadbare Power Rangers t-shirt which was clearly too small for his hulking frame. \u201cMy mother is going to pay for kicking me out! I had squatter\u2019s rights! That was my lifelong home and my mother did nothing but torture me the whole time I was there! My parents neglected me when my other siblings were born so I totally deserve to stay there as long as I want! Nobody knows the hell I have endured!\u201d\n\nWhen questioned about the impending lawsuit being served up by her own son, Janice just shakes her head. \u201cHe only has himself to blame for his situation and obviously, he\u2019s going to lose. Our only crime was being too nice and enabling this sort of behavior. Unfortunately, by coddling a weakling for far too long, I created a monster.\u201d\n\n[adsforwp id=\"70836\"]", "link": "https://nationalreport.net/35-year-old-man-sues-mother-evicted-basement-home/", "published": "2017-11-07T20:57:27+00:00"}, {"title": "Trojan Name New Ultra-Thin Skin Condom after Donald Trump", "text": "Trojan, the world leader in modern condom technology, announced today the company has developed the world\u2019s thinnest-skin condom to date, and will market the new condom after the thinnest-skinned man to ever run for President of the United States, Donald J.

The way the slightly overweight feminist apologetically paused, fought back tears, and forced out a simple, \u201cStuff happened there,\u201d told the story of the pain she\u2019s been carrying since she first started fighting for gender equality almost two years ago.\n\nBradley\u2019s troubles reached an apex the day she organized an anti-Donald Trump rally in Lubbock, Texas. Prudence and a group of fellow UW-M students made the long trek from Madison, WI, to protest Trump\u2019s treatment of women in the Lone Star State.\n\nAlmost an hour into their protest, a man wearing a Make America Great Again hat and confederate flag suspenders approached her and screamed \u201cfeminazi f*ck pig\u201d right to her face. For Mrs. Bradley, it was like being shot point blank in the face with a high-capacity assault weapon.\n\n\u201cI was in a state of total shock,\u201d said Bradley, \u201cI couldn\u2019t feel my legs and thought I may have been paralyzed.\u201d After being treated at a local medical facility for minor emotional distress, Prudence caught the first flight back home to seek a second opinion.\n\n\u201cPrudence was showing all the classic symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD,\u201d said Dr. Liam Williams, Bradley\u2019s family doctor in Madison. \u201cRe-experiencing the trauma through intrusive and distressing recollections of the event, flashbacks, and nightmares are just some of Mrs. Bradley\u2019s symptoms,\u201d warned the doctor. \u201cPrudence was also showing extreme emotional numbness that puts her in a very dangerous category of PTSD. It\u2019s very important she start a treatment program immediately.\u201d\n\nThe Bradley family researched treatment facilities across the country, hoping to find a program that would give their daughter the best overall chance at a full recovery. After almost a month of searching, the family were losing hope until an email from a wounded slacktivist suggested they call the Wounded Social Justice Warrior Project\u00ae in Portland, Oregon.\n\nThe program provides personalized care, services, and advocacy to seriously wounded social justice warriors\u2014including those who have suffered post traumatic stress disorder and other medical health conditions.\n\nBesides adaptive and rehabilitative programs and caregiver support, the WSJWP also provides mentorship to recovering activists, an employment and career readiness program, and financial assistance for those who have suffered or aggravated an injury or illness and need help with daily living activities so they can avoid being hospitalized or put in an outpatient care facility.\n\nFor Prudence, the WSJWP has been a blessing. After a difficult and challenging three months in the program, Mrs. Bradley is starting to feel whole again, and is even looking forward to rejoining her fellow moonbats in time to protest the Republican National Convention next month in Jacksonville.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back,\u201d said Mrs. Bradley with a new found sense of confidence. \u201cI refuse to let these misogynists have the last laugh. This time I\u2019ll be ready for them.\u201d Prudence praises the WSJWP for giving her a second chance, not only at life, but a new sense of purpose to fight for social and economic justice. \u201cThis is my passion and I will never give up, ever.\u201d\n\nAbout the Wounded Social Justice Warrior Project\u00ae\n\nThe mission of the Wounded Social Justice Warrior Project\u00ae is to honor and empower our wounded heroes. Its purpose is to raise awareness of injured social activists, to help find them aid, and to provide unique, direct programs and services to help them continue with their activism.

Known as the acecho \u2013 or stalking \u2013 spider, the astoundingly elusive arachnid can grow to about the size of a small dog. With fangs sharp enough to pierce body armor, the acecho is capable of killing a full-grown adult within seconds of inflicting its venomous bite.\n\nBolivian officials blame increasingly warmer climates for the sharp rise in acecho spider attacks. \u201cThis species is most prevalent in areas known for moderate to frequent volcanic activity,\u201d said Jack Robinson, an Australian-born rainforest biologist and canopy researcher.

However, since the plant\u2019s closure in December of 2014, Greene said business has taken a hit. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing fewer and fewer pink cow births every year,\u201d he said. The solution, according to Greene, is a global proliferation of nuclear power plants. \u201cWe as a society need to embrace the benefits of nuclear energy.

Some qualities and characteristics are solely individual and don\u2019t concern our attitude towards people around us, while others are significant and important for building our view of the world and relations with it, such as sincerity, loyalty, respect, and tolerance.\n\nThe latter two are the qualities that form the basis of modern society. The world isn\u2019t as wide as it once was. Borders and boundaries are blurred, bringing people from different cultures and nations together and forming a multicultural environment we\u2019ve never seen before. The views on traditional relationships and family are changing too. How important are tolerance and respect these days?\n\nThe role of tolerance today:\n\nThe modern world is a world of dialogue and multilingualism of cultures. We\u2019re on the path to expanding the connections between various countries and peoples, and the rapid growth of cultural exchanges and direct contacts between social groups, social movements, and people proves it. The globe speaks different languages, and misunderstandings are inevitable. With all this diversity, tolerance serves as an instrument that helps to overcome cultural differences when we can\u2019t understand what causes them.\n\nLet\u2019s take such a hot topic as religion as an example. In a perfect world, what you believe in is a personal matter, but in reality, it takes one critical comment about religion on social media to hurt someone\u2019s feelings and start a fight. There are only two ways to end religious disputes once and for all: either to merge all religions and beliefs into one or abandon them in favor of atheistic views. It\u2019s unlikely that we\u2019ll ever see one of these options working, so tolerance is the only way to resolve religion-related conflicts and arguments peacefully.\n\nAnother aspect that causes controversy is rapidly changing family values. It seems like some part of the male population will never accept the growing role of women in relationship building. Families led by women are still frowned upon, but thanks to tolerance, the tendency is changing.\n\nThe role of respect\n\nIf tolerance is the instrument, then respect is the mechanism that makes it work. Respect has always been a crucial part of our daily lives, surrounding us on multiple levels. We respect age, wisdom, laws, traditions, and so on. In our time, \u201crespect\u201d is no longer a concept but feeling. We respect someone or something because it should be granted it. For instance, we give respect to the law because we have to or disrespect some people just because we can.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to learn tolerance without learning how to respect. And that\u2019s a tricky task too because of a strong belief that respect must be earned. Some folks just can\u2019t understand why they should tolerate sexual minorities or feminists simply because they\u2019re out there fighting for their rights.\n\nWhile the lack of respect towards others makes it harder to accept different views, nations, and cultures, the lack of it in a relationship can ruin a family, as it implies freedom and trust between partners. There are too many ways to lose respect for the significant other. Selfish actions, secrets, or, conversely, oversharing in relationships destroy confidence and trust that form respect.\n\nSo, without respect, there\u2019s no tolerance, and without tolerance, the world wouldn\u2019t be as colorful and diverse as it is today. Together, the two create a subtle balance between love and hate, allowing us to stay open for new sensations and experiences.", "link": "https://www.huzlers.com/the-importance-of-tolerance-and-respect-in-the-modern-world/", "published": "2019-11-19T09:49:32+00:00"}, {"title": "Popeyes Ranked As America\u2019s Most Dangerous Workplace According To Studies; Wages Set To Be Increased To $20 an Hour Minimum", "text": "UNITED STATES \u2013 Popeyes\u2019 crispy chicken sandwich is back in stores, and it has not disappointed once again.

They always get away with it,'\u201d she recalled her daughter saying.\n\nIn the pardon, Bevin wrote that the case relied on more testimony than physical evidence, and he did not believe the victim\u2019s accusations were true, the Associated Press reports.\n\n\u201c[Bevin has] met my daughter, and now he\u2019s saying that my daughter is a liar \u2026 Shame on him.

That\u2019s why it was so refreshing to read the views of actress Actress Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting on the issue. She stars in the popular sitcom, \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d, and she is making quite an impact of her own. When asked in a Redbook interview if she was a feminist, she responded with,\n\nIs it bad if I say no? It\u2019s not really something I think about.\n\nThings are different now, and I know a lot of the work that paved the way for women happened before I was around. I was never that feminist girl demanding equality, but maybe that\u2019s because I\u2019ve never really faced inequality.\n\nI cook for Ryan five nights a week: It makes me feel like a housewife; I love that. I know it sounds old-fashioned, but I like the idea of women taking care of their men. I\u2019m so in control of my work that I like coming home and serving him. My mom was like that, so I think it kind of rubbed off.\u009d\n\nMy goodness, did a Hollywood actress just say that she LIKED serving her husband? That poor naive woman! Doesn\u2019t she know that taking care of your husband makes you weak? Hasn\u2019t anyone told her that in order to be equal you have to participate in vile acts, like dressing up in vagina costumes or writing demands on your naked body? I mean, how else do you expect to be taken seriously?\n\nLiberals have already started attacking Kaley on Twitter for her comments about feminism. One user tweeted,\n\n\u201cHow can someone who is reaping the benefits of the feminist movement (via her large paycheck) not be a \u201cfeminist\u201d?\n\nAnother offended liberal wrote, \u201cKaley Cuoco-Sweeting\u2019s thoughts on feminism are as tragic as her haircut. Barf.\u201d\n\nKaley responded on twitter by saying \u201d I apologize if I offended anyone. Anyone who knows me knows my heart and knows what I really meant. \u201d\n\nWell, it\u2019s good to know that there are still down to earth people out there, even if they are making millions. Kaley isn\u2019t forgetting the people who helped her make those millions either.\n\nMy parents spent 16 years hauling my butt to LA for audition after audition. Every day they were helping me learn my lines, dropping me off, waiting for me, picking me up, giving me pep talks when I didn\u2019t get the jobs, taking me to tennis and horseback riding lessons.\n\nI remember always hoping I could help take care of them because they took such good care of me. Knowing I\u2019ll be able to just brings tears to my eyes.\n\nNow that is one classy lady.", "link": "https://dcgazette.com/2020/big-bang-theory-actress-asked-feminist-response-made-feminists-furious/", "published": "2020-08-22T20:30:52+00:00"}, {"title": "EPIC!

Schiff misrepresented the call as a gangster-like shakedown, with Trump blatantly threatening the Ukrainian president.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution defines treason as waging war on the U.S. or giving \u201caid and comfort\u201d to American enemies. Punishment for the crime may include the death penalty.\n\nDuring a House hearing Thursday, Schiff tried to ramp up criticism of President Trump portraying him as a mob boss.\n\n\u201cIt reads like a classic organized crime shakedown,\u201d Schiff said of Trump\u2019s call. \u201cShorn of its rambling character and in not so many words, this is the essence of what the president communicates.\u201d\n\nHe then parodied Trump\u2019s call in wildly inaccurate terms.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been very good to your country, very good. No other country has done as much as we have, but you know what? I don\u2019t see much reciprocity here,\u201d Schiff said, supposedly \u201cparodying\u201d Trump\u2019s demands to the Ukrainian leader. \u201cI have a favor I want from you, though, and I\u2019m gonna say this only seven times, so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand, lots of it.\u201d\n\nSchiff explained he was trying to make clear what the president \u201cwas trying to communicate with the president of Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is, in some character, what the president was trying to communicate with the president of Ukraine,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cIt would be funny if it wasn\u2019t such a graphic betrayal of the president\u2019s oath of office.\u201d\n\nSchiff\u2019s remarks received coverage from Fox News.", "link": "https://newspunch.com/president-trump-adam-schiff-arrested-treason/#comments", "published": "2019-09-30T19:17:54+00:00"}, {"title": "Robert De Niro: Trump Is Possibly \u2018Crazy\u2019 In A \u2018Medical Sense\u2019", "text": "President Donald Trump is possibly \u201ccrazy\u201d in the medical sense, according to Robert De Niro, who provided as evidence a bizarre anecdote about the president standing in front of a helicopter and sweating without asking for a handkerchief.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw him out in front of the helicopter waiting to go somewhere and talking endlessly and sweating and sweating and not even \u2014I said, this guy is not even aware of what he\u2019s\u2014he should at least ask somebody for a handkerchief or something and dry himself off.\n\n\u201cThere is something very strange about that,\u201d De Niro said on CNN Sunday morning.\n\nWATCH:\n\nCNN \u201cReliable Sources\u201d host Brian Stelter then asked De Niro if he thought President Trump is an actor playing a role or \u201cperforming.\u201d\n\nDe Niro nodded slowly before saying that \u201cin some ways I think he is\u2026 but in some ways these other pundits on Fox are too, because I can\u2019t believe they would actually buy into this craziness.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis guy should not be president, period.\u201d\n\nHost Brian Stelter said, \u201cWhen you say that, folks on Fox come after you.

The findings could have implications for government policymaking in the many regions of the world where small-scale poultry farming and avian influenza risk co-occur.\n\n\u201cAvian influenza is deadly to humans, with a case fatality rate between 25% and 50%,\u201d said Maciej Boni, associate professor of biology, Penn State. Fortunately, reports of human-to-human transmission over the past 15 years have been either absent or anecdotal. COVID-19 took us by surprise, but with HPAI we have a known threat with the potential to become pandemic. If we ignore the active role that poultry farmers play in the control and dissemination of avian influenza, we may miss another opportunity to curtail an emerging disease outbreak at a stage when it is still controllable.\u201d\n\nLead author Alexis Delabouglise, an animal health economist at CIRAD-Agricultural Research for Development in France who was a postdoctoral scholar at Penn State when the research was performed, explained that small-scale poultry farming is practiced by millions of Vietnamese households and by millions more throughout southeast Asia, mostly on a scale of fewer than 100 birds per farm. These farmers make decisions on a daily basis \u2014 often in response to economic incentives \u2014 about when and where to sell their flocks. And their decisions can influence disease spread.\n\n\u201cIf the price of poultry goes up, farmers might expand their farming activities, which could create more outbreak risk,\u201d said Delabouglise. \u201cIf there is an outbreak on a neighboring farm, they might choose to sell their poultry early to avoid their own birds from being infected and to avoid lower prices. And if there is an outbreak on their own farm, the evidence in our study shows that they would be likely to sell their birds early to avoid both monetary loss and epidemiological risk.\u201d\n\nBoni and colleagues, including researchers at the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit (OUCRU) in Ho Chi Minh City, conducted a longitudinal study of small-scale poultry farms in the Mekong river delta region of southern Vietnam with a goal of characterizing the effects of disease outbreaks on poultry harvest rates, as well as on two prevention practices \u2014 vaccination and farm disinfection. The team followed 53 farmers and their management of more than 1,000 poultry flocks for a period of two years \u2014 from 2015 to 2017.\n\n\u201cWorking with partners in endemic countries day-in and day-out on study details and public health priorities is key to establishing collaborations that allow these long-term follow-up studies to succeed,\u201d said Boni, who led a research group at OUCRU for eight years.\n\nDelabouglise, the statistical lead on the project, used mixed-effects general additive models to investigate farmers\u2019 probabilities of harvesting \u2014 either selling or slaughtering \u2014 flocks, of performing avian influenza vaccination on flocks that were not previously vaccinated and of disinfecting farm facilities when faced with an outbreak. Their findings appeared in eLife on August 25.\n\n\u201cWe found that farmers did send their chickens to market early when there were outbreaks occurring on their farms,\u201d said Delabouglise. \u201cSpecifically, small-scale farmers increased their harvest of broiler chickens by 56% during outbreaks with no sudden deaths and by 214% during outbreaks with sudden deaths. This has the potential to exacerbate the outbreak and spread the virus even further.\u201d\n\nThe team noted that sudden deaths \u2014 the deaths of chickens less than one day after the onset of clinical symptoms \u2014 are considered to be indicative of HPAI infection. Interestingly, the team found that the probability of disinfection was not affected by the occurrence of outbreaks.\n\nFinally, the team found that the likelihood of vaccination against avian influenza strongly increased with flock size. The probability of vaccination was almost zero for flocks of 16 birds or fewer and nearly 100% for flocks of more than 200 birds. According to Delabouglise, one reason that millions of small-scale poultry farmers may not be vaccinating their birds could be their desire to avoid transaction costs associated with declaring flocks to governmental veterinary services before vaccination. Another reason could be that due to their small size, their vaccination status is not controlled and, therefore, vaccination is less worthwhile from the farmers\u2019 perspective.\n\n\u201cCrucially, it is these smaller flocks that are more likely to be sold into trading networks during outbreaks,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rapid sale of sick birds can contaminate other birds at traders\u2019 storage places and those at live bird markets. It also exposes consumers and traders, slaughterers and retailers to an increased risk of infection.\u201d\n\nDelabouglise noted that, on the flip side, a massive arrival of underage birds in a live bird market, or a price decrease due to the temporary oversupply of poultry, may be a sign that an outbreak is occurring.\n\n\u201cThis is an interesting area for surveillance of livestock diseases,\u201d he said.\n\nDelabouglise said that the team\u2019s results could help governmental agencies create policies that aim to avoid the spread of HPAI.\n\n\u201cSmall-scale farmers could play an active role in the control of emerging infectious diseases if they are given the opportunity to depopulate their farm upon disease detection without disseminating pathogens in trade circuits,\u201d he said. \u201cPolicymakers could encourage the establishment of formal trade agreements that encourage such \u2018virtuous\u2019 management of disease outbreaks in poultry.\u201d\n\nOne such \u201cvirtuous\u201d management strategy could be for farmers to sell their sick chickens as feed for pythons and crocodiles raised on neighboring farms. Another could be to set up agreements with neighboring large commercial farmers who can give them financial indemnities to destroy the birds as a way of protecting their own flocks.\n\n\u201cIt would be impossible to have reliable public-health control over the millions of small-scale poultry flocks in a place like Vietnam,\u201d said Delabouglise, \u201cbut providing economic incentives to responsibly manage birds during disease outbreaks is feasible.\u201d\n\nOther authors on the paper include Nguyen Thi Le Thanh, Wellcome Trust Major Overseas Programme; Huynh Thi Ai Xuyen, Ca Mau Sub-Department of Livestock Production and Animal Health; Benjamin Nguyen-VanYen, Wellcome Trust Major Overseas Programme and Ecole Normale Superieure; Phung Ngoc Tuyet, Ca Mau Sub-Department of Livestock Production and Animal Health; and Ha Minh Lam, Wellcome Trust Major Overseas Programme and University of Oxford.\n\nThe Defense Threats Reduction Agency, the Wellcome Trust and the Pennsylvania State University supported this research.\n\n\n\nSpoiler alert!

He also holds joint positions at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) and Technical University Dresden (TUD) in Germany.\n\nThe researchers searched through several deep-sea sediments from two different locations that date back 33,000 years using the extreme sensitivity of HIAF\u2019s mass spectrometer. They found clear traces of the isotope iron-60, which is formed when stars die in supernova explosions.\n\nIron-60 is radioactive and completely decays away within 15 million years, which means any iron-60 found on the earth must have been formed much later than the rest of the 4.6-billion-year old earth and arrived here from nearby supernovae before settling on the ocean floor.\n\nProfessor Wallner previously found traces of iron-60 at about 2.6 million years ago, and possibly another at around 6 million years ago, suggesting earth had traveled through fallout clouds from nearby supernovae.\n\nFor the last few thousand years the solar system has been moving through a denser cloud of gas and dust, known as the local interstellar cloud, (LIC), whose origins are unclear. If this cloud had originated during the past few million years from a supernova, it would contain iron-60, and so the team decided to search more recent sediment to find out.\n\nSure enough, there was iron-60 in the sediment at extremely low levels\u2014equating to radioactivity levels in space far below the Earth\u2019s natural background levels\u2014and the distribution of the iron-60 matched earth\u2019s recent travel through the local interstellar cloud. But the iron-60 extended further back and was spread throughout the entire 33,000 year measurement period.\n\nThe lack of correlation with the solar system\u2018s time in the current local interstellar cloud seems to pose more questions than it answers. Firstly, if the cloud was not formed by a supernova, where did it come from? And secondly, why is there iron-60 so evenly spread throughout space?\n\n\u201cThere are recent papers that suggest iron-60 trapped in dust particles might bounce around in the interstellar medium,\u201d Professor Wallner said.\n\n\u201cSo the iron-60 could originate from even older supernovae explosions, and what we measure is some kind of echo. More data is required to resolve these details.\u201d\n\nScientists from ANU, the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization, HZDR, the University of Vienna and the TU Berlin were involved in the study.\n\nThe findings have been published in the journal PNAS.\n\nThe Everyday Essentials Sale is now live!

With negative interest rates, the present is more valuable than the future, the now seems more desirable than the tomorrow. The attraction of providing for the future is dwindling and with it the very care for the future. However, once the future is neglected, the very present degenerates into stagnation, throwing you back ever more.\n\nCounterproductive Economic Activity\n\nAs a concrete consequence, negative interest rates promote rampant consumerism. Many people\u2019s social propensity to consume tends to be exaggerated. Consumption is becoming a lifestyle. Not only is consumption happening more frequently, but also in greater quantities, not least because it is becoming less and less worthwhile to refrain from consumption, i.e. saving in the true sense of the word. People\u2019s time preferences are completely distorted and hardly correspond to market interest rates.\n\nIf time preferences of market participants and interest rates on the market diverge, malinvestments and misallocation of capital are the logical result. The exaggerations are strongest at the two poles of the economic capital structure. Consumer-related and non-consumer-related areas are flourishing. The interim hype of the fidget spinners or the excess supply of hairdressing salons in small Swiss cities are examples of the former, while the construction boom that has been going on for years in Switzerland is an example of the latter.\n\nLow to negative interest rates make previously unprofitable investments and projects suddenly appear profitable. At the same time, falling interest rates mean that later investors and companies can get into debt at \u201cmore favorable\u201d interest rate conditions. The result: economic activity is fueled even more.\n\nMore intense competition among economic players, fired up by falling interest rates, is increasingly a strain on the latter. On the one hand, economic actors are facing intensifying competition that is squeezing margins. On the other hand, negative interest rates also have a capital-destroying effect, which consequently leads to deflationary tendencies\u2014forces that once again nag at economic actors\u2019 profitability. As a consequence, central banks are rushing to \u201crescue\u201d companies from this real destruction of capital by making more and more liquidity available.\n\nOnly to fuel the fire that is already burning. While interest rates continue to come under pressure due to ongoing floods of liquidity, zombie companies are kept alive. Capital that has actually been used unprofitably is not released to be used and allocated by more solid companies. It remains in ailing corporate structures, which ultimately puts a strain on the overall economy. Competition is intensified to a degree that ultimately does not correspond to the preferences of market participants anymore. If their sovereignty as consumers, investors, and workers were not thwarted by the cheap money of the negative interest rate policy, these very resources would be released and zombie companies would be left to their actual fate.\n\nFrom Risk-Free Interest to Interest-Free Risk\n\nThe existence of zombie companies ultimately affects the morale of employees within an economy. This very morale is likely to decrease especially in the environment of zombified economic structures. Thus, a growing proportion of zombie companies gives birth to more and more so-called bullshit jobs. These jobs are meaningless, as their existence is no longer geared to the preferences and wishes of market participants, and only exist because of liquidity injections, low interest rates, or politically mandated transfer payments.\n\nAlso, the real wages of workers are exposed to continuous devaluation in a negative interest rate environment. In particular, asset price inflation and the resulting decline in yield purchasing power over the years are more significant than many would suspect at first sight.\n\nIn view of these distortions, individual economic actors seem to find that economic processes quickly get out of hand. As their ability to make decisions and coordinate is undermined by ever more cheap liquidity, economic actors, especially if they see themselves as the losers of monetary policy and politics as a whole, feel powerless and frustrated. The economy is mentally impoverished, which is reflected in the consumption of more and more human capital in the form of burnout.\n\nHowever, employees are not the only ones whose profession is made more difficult by negative interest rates. Even the work of the entrepreneur and investor becomes more and more difficult and burdensome with negative interest rates. The important instrument for discounting expected future investment returns is completely reduced to absurdity. If the interest rate is negative, cash values go into infinity and reasonable discounting becomes impossible. Entrepreneurs and investors are in the dark in their intertemporal planning. They make mistakes that they would otherwise be less likely to make.\n\nAssets and goods of all kinds are wrongly priced and will inevitably be repriced again and again by the market. This implies shock-like volatility. Some might be able to profit from this volatility, but most will not, while more and more seem to be affected negatively by it.\n\nNegative interest rates ultimately also cloud hopes of fundamental structural adjustments. They cement, indeed reward, the inability to learn and undermine the sustainable foundations of productivity. The economy and financial markets are increasingly becoming zombified constructs in which sustainability becomes a real farce and any meaning for individual economic actors is quickly lost. The monetary distortions and the economic distortions caused by them are mainly to the detriment of human mental states.\n\nThe Everyday Essentials Sale is now live!

This means a \u20ac1.78 trillion increase year to date. Furthermore, excess liquidity has soared to \u20ac2.9 trillion, a \u20ac1.2 trillion increase since January.\n\nAdded to this unprecedented monetary stimulus, the eurozone has included a record high 10 percent of GDP in various fiscal stimulus programs. None of it has prevented the economy from showing signs of slowing down in August.\n\nAfter a strong bounce in May and June, coming from the reopening of most economies and the base effect, high frequency data compiled by Bloomberg Economics shows an evident slowdown in July and August. All economists who follow the eurozone economy are warning about the worrying weakening of leading indicators. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has also published its July 2020 Leading Indicator Index, which shows that economies like Spain are not just showing signs of weaker growth, but contraction. Italy continues to improve but at a slow pace, while France and Germany post declining growth levels.\n\nThe reason is evident. All the eurozone monster stimulus is focused on perpetuating bloated government budgets and incentivizing noneconomic return or subsidized spending. The entire European Recovery Fund is clearly aimed at promoting white elephants disguised as green projects, but what is more concerning is that the eurozone Green Deal includes more taxes and measures to prevent demand growth than productivity-enhancing plans.\n\nThis lesson should have been learnt in 2009. The European Union launched its massive Growth and Jobs Plan, which rose to more than 1.5 percent of the EU GDP, and the economy did not improve, while more than 4.5 million jobs were lost.\n\nThe problem of these massive stimuli is that they benefit the wrong parts of the economy. Multinationals and national champions that did not have any problem accessing markets in the past are taking advantage of current government spending in entitlements and subsidies and the massive private bond purchases and liquidity injections.\n\nWhile the eurozone is raising \u201cenvironmental\u201d taxes on citizens and promoting subsidized spending in \u201cthe new green deal,\u201d the biggest beneficiaries of the ECB corporate bond purchase program are large automotive companies, oil and gas multinationals, and big multiutilities. The ECB has bought bonds from Shell, Eni, Repsol, OMV, Total, Siemens, Daimler AG, BMW, Volkswagen, Renault, etc. None of these companies had any difficulty accessing capital markets or issuing debt at low rates, and their bonds could not be categorized as cheap in any way considering the yields and spreads. Most of these companies have established and mature businesses in sectors where overcapacity and margin challenges existed way before the previous and current crisis, so they will not increase hiring or capital spending due to the monetary stimulus.\n\nMeanwhile, thousands of startups and small businesses with no access to credit because they have no hard assets are collapsing every month. The monster credit support coming from the transmission mechanism of monetary policy is hoarded by governments and multinationals. It is a massive incentive to overspend and malinvest. Governments feel happy adding more current spending and entitlements with no real economic return, and traditional multinationals that were in slowdown phase years ago are zombified by low rates.\n\nThe ECB and eurozone stimulus plans end up being massive subsidies to low productivity with collateral damage to high-productivity sectors in the form of higher taxes.\n\nThe reader may think that the same can be said about the United States and what the Federal Reserve does. Yes, to a certain extent. The main\u2014and vital\u2014difference is that the United States monetary policy transmission mechanism does not depend on the commercial bank channel. Less than 15 percent of the United States\u2019s real economy is financed by the banking sector thanks to a diversified and flexible private credit system. In the eurozone it is more than 80 percent, similar to Japan.\n\nThis path to long-term stagnation should serve as a reminder for the United States, again, of why it is not advisable to follow the eurozone policies. The results are invariably disastrous.\n\nThe Everyday Essentials Sale is now live!

We are working closely with state and local officials in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi, sparing no effort to save lives. While the hurricane was fierce, one of the strongest to make landfall in 150 years, the casualties and damage were far less than thought possible only 24 hours ago. This is due to the great work of FEMA, law enforcement, and the individual states. I will be going this weekend. We are one national family, and we will always protect, love and care for each other.\n\nHere tonight are the people who have made my journey possible, and filled my life with so much joy.\n\nFor her incredible service to our nation and its children, I want to thank our magnificent First Lady. I also want to thank my amazing daughter Ivanka for that introduction, and to all of my children and grandchildren \u2013 I love you more than words can express. I know my brother Robert is looking down on us right now from Heaven. He was a great brother and was very proud of the job we are doing. Let us also take a moment to show our profound appreciation for a man who has always fought by our side, and stood up for our values \u2013 a man of deep faith and steadfast conviction: Vice President Mike Pence. Mike is joined by his beloved wife, a teacher and military mom, Karen Pence.\n\nMy fellow Americans, tonight, with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism, I proudly accept this nomination for President of the United States.\n\nThe Republican Party, the party of Abraham Lincoln, goes forward united, determined, and ready to welcome millions of Democrats, Independents, and anyone who believes in the GREATNESS of America and the righteous heart of the American People.\n\nIn a new term as President, we will again build the greatest economy in history \u2013 quickly returning to full employment, soaring incomes, and RECORD prosperity! We will DEFEND AMERICA against all threats, and protect America against all dangers. We will LEAD AMERICA into new frontiers of ambition and discovery, and we will reach for new heights of national achievement. We will rekindle new faith in our values, new pride in our history, and a new spirit of unity that can ONLY be realized through love for our country. Because we understand that America is NOT a land cloaked in darkness, America is the torch that enlightens the entire world.\n\nGathered here at our beautiful and majestic White House \u2013 known all over the world as the People\u2019s House \u2013 we cannot help but marvel at the miracle that is our Great American Story. This has been the home of larger-than-life figures like Teddy Roosevelt and Andrew Jackson who rallied Americans to bold visions of a bigger and brighter future. Within these walls lived tenacious generals like Presidents Grant and Eisenhower who led our soldiers in the cause of freedom. From these grounds, Thomas Jefferson sent Lewis and Clark on a daring expedition to cross a wild and uncharted continent. In the depths of a bloody Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln looked out these very windows upon a half-completed Washington Monument \u2013 and asked God, in His Providence, to save our union. Two weeks after Pearl Harbor, Franklin Delano Roosevelt welcomed Winston Churchill, and just inside, they set our people on a course to victory in the Second World War.\n\nIn recent months, our nation, and the entire planet, has been struck by a new and powerful invisible enemy. Like those brave Americans before us, we are meeting this challenge. We are delivering lifesaving therapies, and will produce a vaccine BEFORE the end of the year, or maybe even sooner! We will defeat THE VIRUS, end the pandemic, and emerge stronger than ever before.\n\nWhat united generations past was an unshakable confidence in America\u2019s destiny, and an unbreakable faith in the American People. They knew that our country is blessed by God, and has a special purpose in this world. It is that conviction that inspired the formation of our union, our westward expansion, the abolition of slavery, the passage of civil rights, the space program, and the overthrow of fascism, tyranny and communism.\n\nThis towering American spirit has prevailed over every challenge, and lifted us to the summit of human endeavor.\n\nAnd yet, despite all of our greatness as a nation, everything we have achieved is now endangered. This is the most important election in the history of our country. At no time before have voters faced a clearer choice between two parties, two visions, two philosophies, or two agendas.\n\nThis election will decide whether we SAVE the American Dream, or whether we allow a socialist agenda to DEMOLISH our cherished destiny.\n\nIt will decide whether we rapidly create millions of high paying jobs, or whether we crush our industries and send millions of these jobs overseas, as has foolishly been done for many decades.\n\nYour vote will decide whether we protect law abiding Americans, or whether we give free reign to violent anarchists, agitators, and criminals who threaten our citizens.\n\nAnd this election will decide whether we will defend the American Way of Life, or whether we allow a radical movement to completely dismantle and destroy it.\n\nAt the Democrat National Convention, Joe Biden and his party repeatedly assailed America as a land of racial, economic, and social injustice. So tonight, I ask you a very simple question: How can the Democrat Party ask to lead our country when it spends so much time tearing down our country?\n\nIn the left\u2019s backward view, they do not see America as the most free, just, and exceptional nation on earth. Instead, they see a wicked nation that must be punished for its sins.\n\nOur opponents say that redemption for YOU can only come from giving power to THEM. This is a tired anthem spoken by every repressive movement throughout history.\n\nBut in this country, we don\u2019t look to career politicians for salvation. In America, we don\u2019t turn to government to restore our souls \u2013 we put our faith in Almighty God.\n\nJoe Biden is not the savior of America\u2019s soul \u2013 he is the destroyer of America\u2019s Jobs, and if given the chance, he will be the destroyer of American Greatness.\n\nFor 47 years, Joe Biden took the donations of blue collar workers, gave them hugs and even kisses, and told them he felt their pain \u2013 and then he flew back to Washington and voted to ship their jobs to China and many other distant lands. Joe Biden spent his entire career outsourcing the dreams of American Workers, offshoring their jobs, opening their borders, and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars.\n\nFour years ago, I ran for President because I could not watch this betrayal of our country any longer. I could not sit by as career politicians let other countries take advantage of us on trade, borders, foreign policy and national defense. Our NATO partners, as an example, were far behind in their defense payments. But at my strong urging, they agreed to pay $130 billion more a year. This will ultimately go to $400 billion. Secretary General Stoltenberg, who heads NATO, was amazed, and said that President Trump did what no one else was able to do.\n\nFrom the moment I left my former life behind, and a good life it was, I have done nothing but fight for YOU.\n\nI did what our political establishment never expected and could never forgive, breaking the cardinal rule of Washington Politics. I KEPT MY PROMISES.\n\nTogether, we have ended the rule of the failed political class \u2013 and they are desperate to get their power back by any means necessary. They are angry at me because instead of putting THEM FIRST, I put AMERICA FIRST!\n\nDays after taking office, we shocked the Washington Establishment and withdrew from the last Administration\u2019s job-killing Trans Pacific Partnership. I then approved the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipelines, ended the unfair and costly Paris Climate Accord, and secured, for the first time, American Energy Independence. We passed record-setting tax and regulation cuts, at a rate nobody had ever seen before. Within three short years, we built the strongest economy in the history of the world.\n\nWashington insiders asked me NOT to stand up to China \u2013 they pleaded with me to let China continue stealing our jobs, ripping us off, and robbing our country blind. But I kept my word to the American People. We took the toughest, boldest, strongest, and hardest hitting action against China in American History.\n\nThey said that it would be impossible to terminate and replace NAFTA \u2013 but again, they were wrong. Earlier this year, I ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement into law. Now auto companies and others are building their plants and factories in America, not firing their employees and deserting us.\n\nIn perhaps no area did the Washington special interests try harder to stop us than on my policy of pro-American immigration. But I refused to back down \u2013 and today America\u2019s borders are more secure than EVER before. We ENDED catch-and-release, stopped asylum fraud, took down human traffickers who prey on women and children, and we have deported 20,000 Gang Members and 500,000 Criminal Aliens. We have already built 300 miles of Border Wall \u2013 and we are adding 10 new miles every single week. The Wall will soon be complete, and it is working beyond our wildest expectations.\n\nWe are joined this evening by members of the Border Patrol union, representing our country\u2019s courageous border agents. Thank you all.\n\nWhen I learned that the Tennessee Valley Authority laid off hundreds of American Workers and forced them to train their lower-paid foreign replacements, I promptly removed the Chairman of the Board. And now, those talented American Workers have been RE-HIRED and are back providing power to Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Virginia. They have their old jobs back, and some are here with us this evening. Please stand.\n\nLast month, I took on Big Pharma and signed orders that will massively lower the cost of your prescription drugs, and to give critically ill patients access to lifesaving cures, we passed the decades long-awaited RIGHT TO TRY legislation. We also passed VA Accountability and VA Choice.\n\nBy the end of my first term, we will have approved more than 300 federal judges, including two great new Supreme Court Justices. To bring prosperity to our forgotten inner cities, we worked hard to pass historic criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones, the long-term funding of historically black colleges and universities, and, before the China Virus came in, produced the best unemployment numbers for African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans ever recorded. I have done more for the African-American community than any president since Abraham Lincoln, our first Republican president. I have done more in three years for the black community than Joe Biden has done in 47 years\u2014and when I\u2019m reelected, the best is yet to come!\n\nWhen I took office, the Middle East was in total chaos. ISIS was rampaging, Iran was on the rise, and the war in Afghanistan had no end in sight. I withdrew from the terrible, one-sided Iran Nuclear Deal. Unlike many presidents before me, I kept my promise, recognized Israel\u2019s true capital and moved our Embassy to Jerusalem. But not only did we talk about it as a future site, we got it built. Rather than spending $1 billion on a new building as planned, we took an already owned existing building in a better location, and opened it at a cost of less than $500,000. We also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and this month we achieved the first Middle East peace deal in 25 years. In addition, we obliterated 100 percent of the ISIS Caliphate, and killed its founder and leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Then, in a separate operation, we eliminated the world\u2019s number one terrorist, Qasem Soleimani.\n\nUnlike previous administrations, I have kept America OUT of new wars \u2013 and our troops are coming home. We have spent nearly $2.5 trillion on completely rebuilding our military, which was very badly depleted when I took office. This includes three separate pay raises for our great warriors. We also launched the Space Force, the first new branch of the United States military since the Air Force was created almost 75 years ago.\n\nWe have spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years.\n\nBiden\u2019s record is a shameful roll call of the most catastrophic betrayals and blunders in our lifetime. He has spent his entire career on the wrong side of history. Biden voted for the NAFTA disaster, the single worst trade deal ever enacted; he supported China\u2019s entry into the World Trade Organization, one of the greatest economic disasters of all time. After those Biden calamities, the United States lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs. The laid off workers in Michigan, Ohio, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and many other states didn\u2019t want Joe Biden\u2019s hollow words of empathy, they wanted their jobs back!\n\nAs Vice President, he supported the Trans Pacific Partnership which would have been a death sentence for the U.S. Auto Industry; he backed the horrendous South Korea trade deal, which took many jobs from our country. He repeatedly supported mass amnesty for illegal immigrants. He voted FOR the Iraq War; he opposed the mission to take out Osama bin Laden; he opposed killing Soleimani; he oversaw the rise of ISIS, and cheered the rise of China as \u201ca positive development\u201d for America and the world. That\u2019s why China supports Joe Biden and desperately wants him to win.\n\nChina would own our country if Joe Biden got elected. Unlike Biden, I will hold them fully accountable for the tragedy they caused.\n\nIn recent months, our nation, and the rest of the world, has been hit with a once-in-a-century pandemic that China allowed to spread around the globe. We are grateful to be joined tonight by several of our incredible nurses and first responders \u2013 please stand and accept our profound thanks. Many Americans have sadly lost friends and cherished loved ones to this horrible disease. As one nation, we mourn, we grieve, and we hold in our hearts forever the memories of all of those lives so tragically taken. In their honor, we will unite. In their memory, we will overcome.\n\nWhen the China Virus hit, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II. Invoking the Defense Production Act, we produced the world\u2019s largest supply of ventilators. Not a single American who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator. We shipped hundreds of millions of masks, gloves and gowns to our front line healthcare workers. To protect our nation\u2019s seniors, we rushed supplies, testing kits, and personnel to nursing homes and long term care facilities. The Army Corps of Engineers built field hospitals, and the Navy deployed our great hospital ships.\n\nWe developed, from scratch, the largest and most advanced testing system in the world. America has tested more than every country in Europe put together, and more than every nation in the Western Hemisphere COMBINED. We have conducted 40 million more tests than the next closest nation.\n\nWe developed a wide array of effective treatments, including a powerful anti-body treatment known as Convalescent Plasma that will save thousands of lives. Thanks to advances we have pioneered, the fatality rate has been reduced by 80 percent since April.\n\nThe United States has among the lowest case fatality rates of any major country in the world. The European Union\u2019s case fatality rate is nearly three times higher than ours. Altogether, the nations of Europe have experienced a 30 percent greater increase in excess mortality than the United States.\n\nWe enacted the largest package of financial relief in American history. Thanks to our Paycheck Protection Program, we have saved or supported more than 50 million American jobs. As a result, we have seen the smallest economic contraction of any major western nation, and we are recovering much faster. Over the past three months, we have gained over 9 million jobs, a new record.\n\nUnfortunately, from the beginning, our opponents have shown themselves capable of nothing but a partisan ability to criticize. When I took bold action to issue a travel ban on China, Joe Biden called it hysterical and xenophobic. If we had listened to Joe, hundreds of thousands more Americans would have died.\n\nInstead of following the science, Joe Biden wants to inflict a painful shutdown on the entire country. His shutdown would inflict unthinkable and lasting harm on our nation\u2019s children, families, and citizens of all backgrounds.\n\nThe cost of the Biden shutdown would be measured in increased drug overdoses, depression, alcohol addiction, suicides, heart attacks, economic devastation and more. Joe Biden\u2019s plan is not a solution to the virus, but rather a surrender.\n\nMy Administration has a different approach. To save as many lives as possible, we are focusing on the science, the facts and the data. We are aggressively sheltering those at highest risk \u2013 especially the elderly \u2013 while allowing lower-risk Americans to safely return to work and school.\n\nMost importantly, we are marshalling America\u2019s scientific genius to produce a vaccine in RECORD TIME. Under Operation Warp Speed, we have three different vaccines in the final stage of trials right now, years ahead of what has been achieved before. We are producing them in advance, so that hundreds of millions of doses will be quickly available.\n\nWe will have a safe and effective vaccine this year, and together we will crush the virus.\n\nAt the Democrat convention, you barely heard a word about their agenda. But that\u2019s not because they don\u2019t have one. It\u2019s because their agenda is the most extreme set of proposals ever put forward by a major party nominee. Joe Biden may claim he is an \u201cally of the Light,\u201d but when it comes to his agenda, Biden wants to keep you completely in the dark.\n\nHe has pledged a $4 trillion tax hike on almost all American families, which will totally collapse our rapidly improving economy and once again record stock markets. On the other hand, just as I did in my first term, I will cut taxes even further for hardworking moms and dads, not raise them. We will also provide tax credits to bring jobs out of China BACK to America \u2013 and we will impose tariffs on any company that leaves America to produce jobs overseas. We\u2019ll make sure our companies and jobs stay in our country, as I\u2019ve already been doing. Joe Biden\u2019s agenda is Made in China. My agenda is MADE IN THE USA.\n\nBiden has promised to abolish the production of American oil, coal, shale, and natural gas \u2013 laying waste to the economies of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Colorado, and New Mexico. Millions of jobs will be lost, and energy prices will soar. These same policies led to crippling power outages in California just last week. How can Joe Biden claim to be an \u201cally of the Light\u201d when his own party can\u2019t even keep the lights on?\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s campaign has even published a 110-page policy platform co-authored with Far-Left Senator Bernie Sanders. The Biden-Bernie Manifesto calls for suspending ALL removals of illegal aliens, implementing nationwide Catch-and-Release; and providing illegal aliens with free taxpayer-funded lawyers. Joe Biden recently raised his hand on the debate stage and promised to give away YOUR healthcare dollars to illegal immigrants. He also supports deadly Sanctuary Cities that protect criminal aliens. He promised to end national security travel bans from Jihadist nations, and he pledged to increase refugee admissions by 700 percent. The Biden Plan would eliminate America\u2019s borders in the middle of a global pandemic.\n\nBiden also vowed to oppose School Choice and close down Charter Schools, ripping away the ladder of opportunity for Black and Hispanic children.\n\nIn a second term, I will EXPAND charter schools and provide SCHOOL CHOICE to every family in America. And we will always treat our teachers with the tremendous respect they deserve.\n\nJoe Biden claims he has empathy for the vulnerable \u2013 yet the party he leads supports the extreme late-term abortion of defenseless babies right up to the moment of BIRTH. Democrat leaders talk about moral decency, but they have no problem with stopping a baby\u2019s beating heart in the 9th month of pregnancy.\n\nDemocrat politicians refuse to protect innocent life, and then they lecture us about morality and saving America\u2019s soul? Tonight, we proudly declare that all children, born and unborn, have a GOD-GIVEN RIGHT TO LIFE.\n\nDuring the Democrat Convention, the words \u201cUnder God\u201d were removed from the Pledge of Allegiance \u2013 not once, but twice. The fact is, this is where they are coming from.\n\nIf the left gains power, they will demolish the suburbs, confiscate your guns, and appoint justices who will wipe away your Second Amendment and other Constitutional freedoms.\n\nBiden is a Trojan horse for socialism. If Joe Biden doesn\u2019t have the strength to stand up to wild-eyed Marxists like Bernie Sanders and his fellow radicals, then how is he ever going to stand up FOR you?\n\nThe most dangerous aspect of the Biden Platform is the attack on public safety. The Biden-Bernie Manifesto calls for Abolishing cash bail, immediately releasing 400,000 criminals onto your streets and into your neighborhoods.\n\nWhen asked if he supports cutting police funding, Joe Biden replied, \u201cYes, absolutely.\u201d When Congresswoman Ilhan Omar called the Minneapolis police department a cancer that is \u201crotten to the root,\u201d Biden wouldn\u2019t disavow her support and reject her endorsement \u2013 he proudly displayed it on his website.\n\nMake no mistake, if you give power to Joe Biden, the radical left will Defund Police Departments all across America. They will pass federal legislation to reduce law enforcement nationwide. They will make every city look like Democrat-run Portland, Oregon. No one will be safe in Biden\u2019s America.\n\nMy administration will always stand with the men and women of law enforcement. Every day, police officers risk their lives to keep us safe, and every year, many sacrifice their lives in the line of duty.\n\nOne of these incredible Americans was Detective Miosotis Familia. She was part of a team of American Heroes called the NYPD or New York\u2019s Finest. Three years ago on Fourth of July weekend, Detective Familia was on duty in her vehicle when she was ambushed just after midnight and murdered by a monster who hated her purely for wearing the badge.\n\nDetective Familia was a single mom \u2013 she\u2019d recently asked for the night shift so she could spend more time with her kids. Two years ago, I stood in front of the U.S. Capitol alongside those children, and held their Grandmother\u2019s hand as they mourned their terrible loss and we honored Detective Familia\u2019s extraordinary life.\n\nDetective Familia\u2019s three children are with us this evening. Genesis, Peter, and Delilah, we are so grateful to have you here tonight. I promise you that we will treasure your mom in our memories forever.\n\nWe must remember that the overwhelming majority of police officers in this country are noble, courageous and honorable. We have to give law enforcement, our police, back their power. They are afraid to act. They are afraid to lose their pension. They are afraid to lose their jobs, and by being afraid they are not able to do their jobs. And those who suffer most are the great people who they want so desperately to protect.\n\nWhen there is police misconduct, the justice system must hold wrongdoers fully and completely accountable, and it will. But what we can never have in America \u2013 and must never allow \u2013 is MOB RULE. In the strongest possible terms, the Republican Party condemns the rioting, looting, arson and violence we have seen in Democrat-run cities like Kenosha, Minneapolis, Portland, Chicago, and New York.\n\nThere is violence and danger in the streets of many Democrat-run cities throughout America. This problem could easily be fixed if they wanted to. We must always have law and order. All federal crimes are being investigated, prosecuted, and punished to the fullest extent of the law.\n\nWhen the anarchists started ripping down our statues and monuments, I signed an order, ten years in prison, and it all stopped.\n\nDuring their convention, Joe Biden and his supporters remained completely silent about the rioters and criminals spreading mayhem in Democrat-Run Cities. In the face of left-wing anarchy and mayhem in Minneapolis, Chicago, and other cities, Joe Biden\u2019s campaign did not condemn it \u2013 they DONATED to it. At least 13 members of Joe Biden\u2019s campaign staff donated to a fund to bail out vandals, arsonists, looters, and rioters from jail.\n\nHere tonight is the grieving family of retired police Captain David Dorn, a 38-year veteran of the St. Louis Police Department. In June, Captain Dorn was shot and killed as he tried to protect a store from rioters and looters. We are honored to be joined tonight by his wife Ann and beloved family members: Brian and Kielen. To each of you: we will never forget the heroic legacy of Captain David Dorn.\n\nAs long as I am President, I will defend the absolute right of every American citizen to live in security, dignity, and peace.\n\nIf the Democrat Party wants to stand with anarchists, agitators, rioters, looters, and flag-burners, that is up to them, but I, as your President, will not be a part of it. The Republican Party will remain the voice of the patriotic heroes who keep America Safe.\n\nLast year, over 1,000 African-Americans were murdered as result of violent crime in just four Democrat-run cities. The top 10 most dangerous cities in the country are run by Democrats, and have been for decades. Thousands more African-Americans are victims of violent crime in these communities Joe Biden and the left ignore these American Victims. I NEVER WILL.\n\nIf the Radical Left takes power, they will apply their disastrous policies to every city, town, and suburb in America.\n\nJust imagine if the so-called peaceful demonstrators in the streets were in charge of every lever of power in the U.S. Government.\n\nLiberal politicians claim to be concerned about the strength of American institutions. But who, exactly, is attacking them? Who is hiring the radical professors, judges, and prosecutors? Who is trying to abolish immigration enforcement, and establish speech codes designed to muzzle dissent? In every case, the attacks on American institutions are being waged by the radical left.\n\nAlways Remember: they are coming after ME, because I am fighting for YOU.\n\nWe must reclaim our independence from the left\u2019s repressive mandates. Americans are exhausted trying to keep up with the latest list of approved words and phrases, and the ever-more restrictive political decrees. Many things have a different name now, and the rules are constantly changing. The goal of cancel culture is to make decent Americans live in fear of being fired, expelled, shamed, humiliated, and driven from society as we know it. The far-left wants to coerce you into saying what you know to be FALSE, and scare you out of saying what you know to be TRUE.\n\nBut on November 3rd, you can send them a thundering message they will never forget!\n\nJoe Biden is weak. He takes his marching orders from liberal hypocrites who drive their cities into the ground while fleeing far from the scene of the wreckage. These same liberals want to eliminate school choice, while they enroll their children in the finest private schools in the land. They want to open our borders while living in walled-off compounds and communities. They want to defund the police, while they have armed guards for themselves.\n\nThis November, we must turn the page FOREVER on this failed political class. The fact is, I\u2019m here, and they\u2019re not \u2013 and that\u2019s because of YOU. Together, we will write the next chapter of the Great American Story.\n\nOver the next four years, we will make America into the Manufacturing Superpower of the World. We will expand Opportunity Zones, bring home our medical supply chains, and we will end our reliance on China once and for all.\n\nWe will continue to reduce taxes and regulations at levels not seen before.\n\nWe will create 10 million jobs in the next 10 months.\n\nWe will hire MORE police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and surge federal prosecutors into high-crime communities.\n\nWe will BAN deadly Sanctuary Cities, and ensure that federal healthcare is protected for American Citizens \u2013 not illegal aliens.\n\nWe will have strong borders, strike down terrorists who threaten our people, and keep America OUT of endless and costly foreign wars.\n\nWe will appoint prosecutors, judges, and justices who believe in enforcing the LAW \u2013 not their own political agenda.\n\nWe will ensure equal justice for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed.\n\nWe will uphold your religious liberty, and defend your Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.\n\nWe will protect Medicare and Social Security.\n\nWe will always, and very strongly, protect patients with pre-existing conditions, and that is a pledge from the entire Republican Party.\n\nWe will END surprise medical billing, require price transparency, and further reduce the cost of prescription drugs and health insurance premiums.\n\nWe will greatly expand energy development, continuing to remain number one in the world, and keep America Energy Independent.\n\nWe will win the race to 5G, and build the world\u2019s best cyber and missile defense.\n\nWe will fully restore patriotic education to our schools, and always protect free speech on college campuses.\n\nWe will launch a new age of American Ambition in Space. America will land the first WOMAN on the moon \u2013 and the United States will be the first nation to plant its flag on Mars.\n\nThis is the unifying national agenda that will bring our country TOGETHER.\n\nSo tonight, I say again to all Americans: This is the most important election in the history of our country. There has never been such a difference between two parties, or two individuals, in ideology, philosophy, or vision than there is right now.\n\nOur opponents believe that America is a depraved nation.\n\nWe want our sons and daughters to know the truth: America is the greatest and most exceptional nation in the history of the world!\n\nOur country wasn\u2019t built by cancel culture, speech codes, and soul-crushing conformity. We are NOT a nation of timid spirits. We are a nation of fierce, proud, and independent American Patriots.\n\nWe are a nation of pilgrims, pioneers, adventurers, explorers and trailblazers who refused to be tied down, held back, or reined in. Americans have steel in their spines, grit in their souls, and fire in their hearts. There is no one like us on earth.\n\nI want every child in America to know that you are part of the most exciting and incredible adventure in human history. No matter where your family comes from, no matter your background, in America, ANYONE CAN RISE. With hard work, devotion, and drive, you can reach any goal and achieve every ambition.\n\nOur American Ancestors sailed across the perilous ocean to build a new life on a new continent. They braved the freezing winters, crossed the raging rivers, scaled the rocky peaks, trekked the dangerous forests, and worked from dawn till dusk. These pioneers didn\u2019t have money, they didn\u2019t have fame\u2013 but they had each other. They loved their families, they loved their country, and they loved their God!\n\nWhen opportunity beckoned, they picked up their Bibles, packed up their belongings, climbed into covered wagons, and set out West for the next adventure. Ranchers and miners, cowboys and sheriffs, farmers and settlers \u2013 they pressed on past the Mississippi to stake a claim in the Wild Frontier.\n\nLegends were born \u2013 Wyatt Earp, Annie Oakley, Davy Crockett, and Buffalo Bill.\n\nAmericans built their beautiful homesteads on the Open Range. Soon they had churches and communities, then towns, and with time, great centers of industry and commerce. That is who they were. Americans build the future, we don\u2019t tear down the past!\n\nWe are the nation that won a revolution, toppled tyranny and fascism, and delivered millions into freedom. We laid down the railroads, built the great ships, raised up the skyscrapers, revolutionized industry, and sparked a new age of scientific discovery. We set the trends in art and music, radio and film, sport and literature \u2013 and we did it all with style, confidence and flair. Because THAT is who we are.\n\nWhenever our way of life was threatened, our heroes answered the call.\n\nFrom Yorktown to Gettysburg, from Normandy to Iwo Jima, American Patriots raced into cannon blasts, bullets and bayonets to rescue American Liberty.\n\nBut America didn\u2019t stop there. We looked into the sky and kept pressing onward. We built a 6 million pound rocket, and launched it thousands of miles into space. We did it so that two brave patriots could stand tall and salute our wondrous American flag planted on the face of the Moon.\n\nFor America, nothing is impossible.\n\nOver the next four years, we will prove worthy of this magnificent legacy. We will reach stunning new heights. And we will show the world that, for America, no dream is beyond our reach.\n\nTogether, we are unstoppable. Together, we are unbeatable. Because together, we are the proud CITIZENS of the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. And on November 3rd, we will make America safer, we will make America stronger, we will make America prouder, and we will make America GREATER than ever before! Thank you, God Bless You. God Bless America \u2014 GOODNIGHT!"}, {"link": "https://www.infowars.com/us-marshals-rescue-dozens-of-missing-children-in-georgia/", "published": "2020-08-28T15:09:48", "title": "US Marshals Rescue Dozens of Missing Children in Georgia", "text": "The US Marshals Service Missing Child Unit has rescued 26 children and confirmed the safety of an additional 13, while arresting nine people for child trafficking-related offenses in Atlanta and Macon, Georgia.\n\nThe children rescued were aged between three and 17 years old, and 15 were confirmed as victims of sex trafficking.\n\nThe massive sweep concluded the two-week-long Operation Not Forgotten, as officers cleared 26 arrest warrants in total, including charges for sex trafficking, parental kidnapping, registered sex offender violations, drugs and weapons possession, and custodial interference.\n\n\u201cThe message to missing children and their families is that we will never stop looking for you,\u201d said Director of the US Marshals Service (USMS) Donald Washington, who praised the success of the operation that aimed to recover \u201csome of the most at-risk and challenging recovery cases in the area.\u201d\n\nWashington highlighted the particular concerns of law enforcement, both local and federal, about the potential for child sex trafficking, child exploitation, sexual abuse and physical abuse, in addition to medical or mental health conditions among some of the children.\n\nWhen we track down fugitives, it\u2019s a good feeling to know that we\u2019re putting the bad guy behind bars.

According to one new survey, 61 percent of Americans need \u201canother relief bill\u201d, and about two-thirds of Americans from the age of 24 to the age of 54 say that they are currently in financial distress\u2026\n\nThe latest survey by MagnifyMoney reveals 61 percent of the country needs another relief bill to pay for expenses. Over 80 percent of workers who have been laid off or furloughed due to COVID-19 are counting on more assistance. The poll of 1,010 Americans adds 71 percent of Generation X (ages 40 to 54) and 65 percent of millennials (ages 24 to 39) say they are currently in financial distress.\n\nIf you are not in financial distress at this moment, you should be very thankful for your blessings, because you are definitely in the minority.\n\nAnd more layoff announcements just keep on coming with each passing day. On Thursday, we learned that Lord & Taylor will be laying off all their workers and closing every single store\u2026\n\nLord & Taylor, the first department store established in the United States, is officially going out of business, ending a nearly 200-year run. The bankrupt company announced Thursday that all of its 38 remaining stores and website have begun liquidation sales \u2014 a reversal from last week\u2019s decision to keep 14 locations open.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I was always so intimidated by Lord & Taylor when my mother would take me to the mall.\n\nI always thought that was where the rich people shopped.\n\nI never imagined that someday I would see it go out of business forever.\n\nOf course countless other retailers are going belly up as the worst \u201cretail apocalypse\u201d in U.S. history rolls on. According to Coresight Research, approximately 25 percent of all malls in the United States \u201cwill close over the next three to five years\u201d\u2026\n\nAnother new report out this week from Coresight Research estimates 25% of America\u2019s roughly 1,000 malls will close over the next three to five years, with the pandemic accelerating a demise that was already underway before the new virus emerged.\n\nCan you imagine what our country is going to look like if that actually happens?\n\nAlready, communities all over America are being blighted by one boarded up property after another, and this is especially true in many impoverished areas.\n\nOf course our economic problems have been accelerated by a series of very unusual events that have been beyond our control. It has been one thing after another here in 2020, and the latest major disaster to hit us was Hurricane Laura. We were extremely fortunate that neither New Orleans or Houston took a direct hit from this storm, because it was enormously destructive. Just consider what one survivor told the press about the devastation in his community\u2026\n\n\u201cIt looks like 1,000 tornadoes went through here. It\u2019s just destruction everywhere,\u201d said Brett Geymann, who rode out the storm with three family members in Moss Bluff, near Lake Charles, Louisiana. He described Laura passing over his house with the roar of a jet engine around 2 a.m.\n\nLet us hope that we will have at least a little bit of time before the next major crisis comes along. Many had been hoping that August would be a quiet month, but that didn\u2019t turn out to be the case, and now September is just a few days away.\n\nAnd as we approach the fall season, it is being reported that wealthy investors have been \u201choarding cash\u201d\u2026\n\nA group of multimillionaire investors in the U.S. are hoarding cash at unprecedented levels. Tiger 21, a club of more than 800 investors, reported Thursday that its members have raised their cash holdings to 19% of their total assets on concerns over the economic consequences of the covid pandemic in the U.S. That\u2019s up from about 12% since the start of the outbreak. About a quarter now expect the crisis to continue until the end of next June, the group said.\n\nIs this a sign that many of them believe that trouble is ahead for the financial markets?\n\nOf course it isn\u2019t just the wealthy that are deeply concerned about the months ahead. Our nation has been gripped by endless turmoil for most of this year, and now a very hotly contested presidential election is just over two months away. Meanwhile, economic conditions will continue to deteriorate, and that means that tens of millions of Americans will become even more angry and even more frustrated. If you believe that the U.S. is just going to snap out of all of this somehow and everything will turn out just fine in the end, then you simply do not understand the times in which we are living.\n\nFor so long we were warned that a \u201cperfect storm\u201d was coming, and now it is here.\n\nAnd if you think that 2020 has been bad, just wait until you see what else is ahead.\n\nThe Everyday Essentials Sale is now live!

This means that Andromeda\u2019s halo is already bumping into the halo of our own galaxy.\n\nThey also found that the halo has a layered structure, with two main nested and distinct shells of gas. This is the most comprehensive study of a halo surrounding a galaxy.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding the huge halos of gas surrounding galaxies is immensely important,\u201d explained co-investigator Samantha Berek of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. \u201cThis reservoir of gas contains fuel for future star formation within the galaxy, as well as outflows from events such as supernovae. It\u2019s full of clues regarding the past and future evolution of the galaxy, and we\u2019re finally able to study it in great detail in our closest galactic neighbor.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe find the inner shell that extends to about a half million light-years is far more complex and dynamic,\u201d explained study leader Nicolas Lehner of the University of Notre Dame in Indiana. \u201cThe outer shell is smoother and hotter. This difference is a likely result from the impact of supernova activity in the galaxy\u2019s disk more directly affecting the inner halo.\u201d\n\nA signature of this activity is the team\u2019s discovery of a large amount of heavy elements in the gaseous halo of Andromeda. Heavier elements are cooked up in the interiors of stars and then ejected into space\u2014sometimes violently as a star dies. The halo is then contaminated with this material from stellar explosions.\n\nThe Andromeda galaxy, also known as M31, is a majestic spiral of perhaps as many as 1 trillion stars and comparable in size to our Milky Way. At a distance of 2.5 million light-years, it is so close to us that the galaxy appears as a cigar-shaped smudge of light high in the autumn sky. If its gaseous halo could be viewed with the naked eye, it would be about three times the width of the Big Dipper. This would easily be the biggest feature on the nighttime sky.\n\nThrough a program called Project AMIGA (Absorption Map of Ionized Gas in Andromeda), the study examined the light from 43 quasars\u2014the very distant, brilliant cores of active galaxies powered by black holes\u2014located far beyond Andromeda. The quasars are scattered behind the halo, allowing scientists to probe multiple regions. Looking through the halo at the quasars\u2019 light, the team observed how this light is absorbed by the Andromeda halo and how that absorption changes in different regions. The immense Andromeda halo is made of very rarified and ionized gas that doesn\u2019t emit radiation that is easily detectable. Therefore, tracing the absorption of light coming from a background source is a better way to probe this material.\n\nThis illustration depicts the gaseous halo of the Andromeda galaxy if it could be seen with the naked eye. At a distance of 2.5 million light-years, the majestic spiral Andromeda galaxy is so close to us that it appears as a cigar-shaped smudge of light high in the autumn sky.

DePasquale and E. Wheatley (STScI), and Z. Levay (background image)\n\nThe researchers used the unique capability of Hubble\u2019s Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) to study the ultraviolet light from the quasars. Ultraviolet light is absorbed by Earth\u2019s atmosphere, which makes it impossible to observe with ground-based telescopes. The team used COS to detect ionized gas from carbon, silicon, and oxygen. An atom becomes ionized when radiation strips one or more electrons from it.\n\nAndromeda\u2019s halo has been probed before by Lehner\u2019s team. In 2015, they discovered that the Andromeda halo is large and massive. But there was little hint of its complexity; now, it\u2019s mapped out in more detail, leading to its size and mass being far more accurately determined.\n\n\u201cPreviously, there was very little information\u2014only six quasars\u2014within 1 million light-years of the galaxy. This new program provides much more information on this inner region of Andromeda\u2019s halo,\u201d explained co-investigator J. Christopher Howk, also of Notre Dame. \u201cProbing gas within this radius is important, as it represents something of a gravitational sphere of influence for Andromeda.\u201d\n\nBecause we live inside the Milky Way, scientists cannot easily interpret the signature of our own galaxy\u2019s halo. However, they believe the halos of Andromeda and the Milky Way must be very similar since these two galaxies are quite similar. The two galaxies are on a collision course, and will merge to form a giant elliptical galaxy beginning about 4 billion years from now.\n\nScientists have studied gaseous halos of more distant galaxies, but those galaxies are much smaller on the sky, meaning the number of bright enough background quasars to probe their halo is usually only one per galaxy. Spatial information is therefore essentially lost. With its close proximity to Earth, the gaseous halo of Andromeda looms large on the sky, allowing for a far more extensive sampling.\n\n\u201cThis is truly a unique experiment because only with Andromeda do we have information on its halo along not only one or two sightlines, but over 40,\u201d explained Lehner. \u201cThis is groundbreaking for capturing the complexity of a galaxy halo beyond our own Milky Way.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Andromeda is the only galaxy in the universe for which this experiment can be done now, and only with Hubble. Only with an ultraviolet-sensitive future space telescope will scientists be able to routinely undertake this type of experiment beyond the approximately 30 galaxies comprising the Local Group.\n\n\u201cSo Project AMIGA has also given us a glimpse of the future,\u201d said Lehner.\n\nThe team\u2019s findings appear in the Aug. 27 edition of The Astrophysical Journal.\n\nThe Everyday Essentials Sale is now live!

It was expected that money supply growth would surge in recent months. This usually happens in the wake of the early months of a recession or financial crisis. But it appears that now the United States is several months into an extended economic crisis, with around 1 million new jobless claims each week now the \u201cnorm\u201d for the past two months. The central bank continues to engage in a wide variety of unprecedented efforts to \u201cstimulate\u201d the economy and provide income to the approximately 12 to 15 million unemployed workers. Moreover, as government revenues have fallen considerably, Congress has turned to unprecedented amounts of borrowing. But in order to keep interest rates low, the Fed has been buying up trillions in assets\u2014including government debt. This has fueled new money creation.\n\nDuring July 2020, year-over-year (YOY) growth in the money supply was at 36.9 percent. That\u2019s up from June\u2019s rate of 34.4 percent, and up from July 2019\u2019s rate of 2.21 percent. Historically this is a very large surge in growth, both month over month and year over year. It is also quite a reversal from the trend that only just ended in August of last year, when growth rates were nearly bottoming out around 2 percent. In August, the growth rate hit a 120-month low, falling to the lowest growth rates we\u2019d seen since 2007.\n\nThe money supply metric used here\u2014the \u201ctrue\u201d or Rothbard-Salerno money supply measure (TMS)\u2014is the metric developed by Murray Rothbard and Joseph Salerno, and is designed to provide a better measure of money supply fluctuations than M2. The Mises Institute now offers regular updates on this metric and its growth. This measure of the money supply differs from M2 in that it includes Treasury deposits at the Fed (and excludes short-time deposits, traveler\u2019s checks, and retail money funds).\n\nThe M2 growth rate also increased to historic highs in July, growing 23.2 percent compared to June\u2019s growth rate of 22.8 percent. M2 grew 5 percent during July of last year. The M2 growth rate had fallen considerably from late 2016 to late 2018 but has been growing again in recent months. As of March, it is following the same trend as TMS.\n\nMoney supply growth can often be a helpful measure of economic activity. During periods of economic boom, money supply tends to grow quickly as banks make more loans. Recessions, on the other hand, tend to be preceded by periods of slowdown in rates of money supply growth. However, money supply growth tends to grow out of its low-growth trough well before the onset of recession. As recession nears, the TMS growth rate climbs and becomes larger than the M2 growth rate. This occurred in the early months of the 2002 and the 2009 crises. February 2020 was the first month since late 2008 that the TMS growth rate climbed higher than the M2 growth rate. The TMS growth rate again exceeded M2 in March, April, and June 2020. As of mid-July 2020, it does appear that the decline in money supply growth has again preceded a recession, and a severe one at that. GDP fell 9.5 percent year over year during the second quarter of 2020. While a single quarter of decline would not meet the definition of \u201crecession\u201d now commonly used by economists, the US will have to stage an enormous economic comeback during the third quarter to avoid what most everyone will admit is a serious recession.\n\nAlthough some observers will likely claim that the current economic crisis is a result solely of the covid-19 panic and resulting government-forced shutdowns, several indicators do suggest that the economy was primed for a recession. The preceding decline in TMS is one of these indicators, as is the late 2019 liquidity crisis in the repo markets. The Fed\u2019s moves to drop interest rates and to once again grow its balance sheet speak to the weakness of the economy leading up to April 2020.\n\nAfter initial balance sheet growth in late 2019, total Fed assets surged to nearly $7.2 trillion in June and have rarely dipped below the $7 trillion mark since then. These new asset purchases have set a new all-time high and are propelling the Fed balance sheet far beyond anything seen during the Great Recession\u2019s stimulus packages. The Fed\u2019s assets are now up more than 600 percent from the period immediately preceding the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nWhile Fed asset purchases are not solely responsible for the surge in new money creation, they are certainly a sizable factor. Bank loan activity has surged as well, also driving new money creation.\n\nBelow is the dollar volume for M2 and TMS:\n\nIn terms of total dollar amounts now extant, the overall M2 total money supply in July was $18.2 trillion and the TMS total was $18.4 trillion. Since January, this is an increase of $2.8 trillion in M2 and $4.2 trillion in the TMS.\n\nThe Everyday Essentials Sale is now live!

The only \u201cmystery\u201d here is why\u2014contrary to centuries of economic wisdom\u2014we allowed centralized paper money to become the dominant form of currency in the first place.\n\nAs recent waves of civil unrest and economic turmoil have prompted some to look back in time and reflect on the observations of the Founding Fathers, it seems most have opted to reject them entirely. Yet among the founders\u2019 many warnings against the institutions that would eventually dominate the modern world are the timeless\u2014and astonishingly accurate\u2014warnings against central banking.\n\nOn August 1, 1787, George Washington wrote in a letter to Thomas Jefferson that \u201cpaper currency [can] ruin commerce, oppress the honest, and open the door to every species of fraud and injustice.\u201d Jefferson also opposed the concept, warning that \u201cbanking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies.\u201d James Madison called paper money \u201cunjust,\u201d recognizing that it allowed the government to confiscate and redistribute property through inflation: \u201cIt affects the rights of property as much as taking away equal value in land.\u201d\n\nIn other words, inflation is a hidden form of taxation. Washington understood this. Jefferson understood this. Madison understood this. And generations of preeminent economists since then\u2014from Ludwig von Mises to F.A. Hayek, to Murray Rothbard\u2014have understood this quite clearly.\n\nAnd there\u2019s nothing controversial or mysterious about sound money, that is, currency backed by some form of secure, fixed weight commodity like gold or silver. Both have been valued in some fashion for six thousand years and have been used as currency for around twenty-six hundred years. As confidence in the dollar continues to nosedive, the market is not only putting more confidence in gold and silver, but in some cryptocurrencies sharing many of the characteristics of gold.\n\nThe presidencies of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin D. Roosevelt are rightfully regarded as some of the darkest years for freedom in America. Often overlooked, however, are the deeply repressive monetary policies introduced by both presidents. In 1838, Senator John C. Calhoun foreshadowed the economic evils that would eventually emerge at the peak of the Progressive Era, explaining, \u201cIt is the nature of stimulus\u2026to excite first, and then depress afterwards\u2026.Nothing is more stimulating than an expanding and depreciating currency. It creates a delusive appearance of prosperity, which puts everything in motion. Everyone feels as if he was growing richer as prices rise.\u201d\n\nSeventy-five years later, the autocrats running the Wilson administration dealt two devastating blows to liberty with the Federal Reserve Act and the Revenue Act, forever marking 1913 as a tragic year for liberty. Both laws struck at the heart of property rights by establishing the Federal Reserve System and the income tax, respectively. Then, in 1933, Roosevelt issued Executive Order No. 6102, requiring Americans to surrender much of their gold to the US government. Shortly after, Congress passed the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, artificially raising the price of gold and guaranteeing the government a profit of $14.33 for each ounce of gold it had seized from the people.\n\nFinally, in 1971, President Richard Nixon\u2014like any self-respecting twentieth-century Keynesian\u2014committed himself to finishing the work of Wilson and Roosevelt by closing the gold window, forever divorcing the gold standard from the dollar. Rather than usher in a new era of economic stability, this unnatural union between the Fed and the federal government produced a vicious loop of boom-bust cycles and depressions. The consequences have not only been inflation and devaluation (both of which have stripped the people of their purchasing power and savings); now, every time a depression hits, the government is allowed to do two things: grow its power and tax and spend at will without fear of accountability.\n\nIn other words, with every inflation of currency comes an inflation of government power.\n\nWith government shutdowns of local economies, the second economic quarter of this year was among the worst in history, with the total debt-to-GDP reaching a staggering 136 percent. As the national debt approaches $27 trillion (with even bigger spending bills in the works), we can expect the days of such flagrant government spending to come to a screeching halt. If we continue on this path, that correction will result in an unprecedented collapse of the dollar and the monetary system. The ultimate danger in this scenario: the government eventually confiscates the vast majority or even all private property in order to pay off the national debt. As German American economist Hans Sennholz once said, \u201cGovernment debt is a government claim against personal income and private property\u2014an unpaid tax bill.\u201d\n\nThis is why a dramatic downsizing of government is key to bringing the US out of this manic, outmoded cycle of depressions and upswings. For the government to fulfill its core function as a safeguard of liberty, we must prevent it from meddling in affairs beyond the boundaries prescribed by the Founding Fathers. This includes a swift withdrawal from the use of paper fiat currency and spending cuts across the board.\n\nSuch a sweeping transformation could begin with the state governments, the legislatures of which could override the federal government by passing legislation allowing individuals to use gold and silver currency.\n\nRegardless, if meaningful legislative action is not taken somewhere, we have little choice other than to acquiesce to the gloom and terror of socialism\u2014a system that would devour all in its path and make slaves of once free people for generations to come. Freedom is the natural ability of people to control their own destiny. Sound money has the ability to help keep people free.\n\nThe Everyday Essentials Sale is now live!

As we have explained, to really understand what\u2019s going on, you need to flip the equation. Dollars are at an all-time record low compared to gold. Simply put, the recent surge in gold prices is all about currency debasement.\n\nWe were on this path long before coronavirus reared its ugly head. After all, this gold bull market started back in 2015. But the government response to the pandemic put the process in hyperdrive. In March, the Federal Reserve embarked on a policy of money printing to infinity and beyond. And there is no end in sight. The Fed is apparently even willing to turn the other way the inevitable result of printing money \u2013 price inflation \u2013 begins to become apparent in the economy.\n\nAs economist Patrick Barron pointed out in an article published at the Mises Wire, unsound money has been at the heart of disastrous government policies throughout history. This time is no different. The Fed \u201ccure\u201d for the coronavirus economic meltdown is really part of the problem.\n\nThe following article by Patrick Barron was originally published at the Mises Wire. The opinions expressed for your consideration are the author\u2019s and do not necessarily reflect those of Peter Schiff or SchiffGold.\n\nAustrian school economists know that unsound money has been at the heart of disastrous government policies since time immemorial. The greater the ignorance of money, the greater the monetary debasement in order to fund government\u2019s latest folly.\n\nMonetary debasement always ends badly, but end it will. Robert L. Shuettinger and Eamon Butler, cofounder and director of the Adam Smith Institute, wrote Forty Centuries of Wage and Price Controls: How Not to Fight Inflation (2009), a very readable short book that covers a vast expanse of time. In The Ethics of Money Production, J\u00f6rg Guido H\u00fclsmann outlined all the various schemes used over the millennia by those in government to counterfeit the lifeblood of the economy for their own purposes. But Professor Hulsmann, who wrote the book in 2010, probably could not have predicted the scale of today\u2019s money expansion. What is the point of all this?\n\nWell, the point is that the ignorant public and the tyrants who rule them apparently believe that all that is wanting to achieve some great goal is money. And since government can conjure all the money that it desires out of thin air, government ought to do so. It\u2019s really as simple as that.\n\nFiat Money Makes Keynesian Economics Appear to Be Possible\n\nAlong the way some almost universally accepted economic principles have had to be shunted aside. John Maynard Keynes, author of The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money and considered to be the father of modern macroeconomics, managed to concoct a new economic school of thought that completely ignored Say\u2019s law. No longer was money an indirect medium of exchange to facilitate the transfer of real goods and services for other real goods and services, what Frank Shostak calls the exchange of \u201csomething for something.\u201d No. Now money itself could be conjured out of thin air and used to confiscate real goods and services. No longer would government be forced to convince its constituents that its latest spending proposal was so necessary that it could justify an increase in taxes and/or the reduction or elimination of some other spending programs. Barring the failure of those two funding options, it would no longer be forced, as it had in the past, to convince savers that its credit was good. In other words, spending would be completely unshackled from the reality of uncertainty and scarcity.\n\nFiat Money Hides the Consequences of Lockdowns\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has exposed the hollowness of what is called modern monetary theory (MMT). The horrible consequences of government shutdowns throughout the country have been truly \u201cpapered over\u201d with trillions of dollars of fiat money through so-called stimulus checks, handouts to politically connected businesses, and boosts in unemployment payments. Real money would have revealed the damage to the world economy long ago, and I am do not doubt that shutdowns would have quickly stopped being used as a tool for controlling the virus. As it is, the shutdowns linger in many parts of the world, because the consequences are not yet fully seen.\n\nThe End of the Credit Cycle\n\nYet the coronavirus-inspired shutdowns and helicopter money to placate a frightened populace are merely the latest examples of foolish government policies made possible only by the government\u2019s ability to conjure money out of thin air. The broader background of weakening bank balance sheets has ensured a recession and possibly a depression through bank credit expansion funded not by an increase in real savings but central banks. In his latest warning that the end of the most recent credit cycle is nigh, Alasdair Macleod of Goldmoney.com paints a bleak picture of the weakness of the \u201cglobally systemically important banks\u201d (G-SIBs):\n\nthe elephant in the room is systemic risk \u2014 visible to all but simply ignored. This is partly due to everyone in government and central banks, as well as their epigones in the investment industry and mainstream media, believing our economic problems are only a matter of Covid-19. Governments have introduced emergency plans. The US Government is distributing money by metaphorical helicopters, and Britain has a furlough scheme and tax deferments. But they do little to alleviate the concerns of highly leveraged commercial bankers, facing the prospects of soaring bad debts. Bank balance sheet asset values to market capitalisation ratios strongly suggest the banking system cannot cope with what is ahead.\n\nThere is NOTHING that government can do to help the economy other than remove barriers to wealth creation and preservation that it itself created and allow the people the freedom to pursue their own ends. Since government creates nothing itself, all interventions interfere with what the people themselves desire and are nothing more than transfers of wealth for the benefit of some and the destruction of wealth for all. Yet wealth destruction may not be the worst thing that can happen. A nation can lose its freedom entirely when government doubles down and doubles down time and again in the pursuit of phantom fixes with ever-increasing amounts of fiat money conjured out of thin air. It happened in Rome (Inflation and the Fall of Rome, a speech by Joseph R. Peden). It happened in Weimar Germany (When Money Dies, by Adam Fergusson).\n\nIt certainly can happen here and now.\n\nAbout the Author: Patrick Barron is a private consultant to the banking industry.

Yet, light waves from a shrinking object are lengthened, or redshifted. The evidence of both of these shifts comes in handy not merely in determining rotation as such, but the velocity of this rotation.\n\n\u201cOur simulations show that what we observe is very sensitive to the inclination. There is a preferred orientation to see these double-peak features, and a different orientation to see X-ray emissions\u201d, according to Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz, who in 2018 co-authored a paper presenting a unified model for tidal disruption events.\n\nThe team moved on to make further multi-wavelength observations, likening them to other TDEs, and finally arrived at conclusions that the accretion disc was made up of around five percent of the star\u2019s initial mass and that it formed quickly, within just one month. A similar conclusion was, incidentally, reached by an international team of researchers led by astronomer Phil Short of the University of Edinburgh in Scotland.\n\nIn a pre-print arXiv paper, Short and his team note that \u201cAT 2018hyz is the first TDE in which clear, double-peaked emission lines have been observed and provides strong observational evidence that accretion discs form in at least some TDEs and are a significant source of the observed luminosity\u201d.\n\n\n\nKnow your history or be doomed to repeat it!\n\nThe Everyday Essentials Sale is now live!

As Rittenhouse ran toward police vehicles approaching the scene, Rosenbaum and others appear to have tackled Rittenhouse. One man attacked him with a skateboard, while another man had a pistol.\n\nHuber was arrested in 2012 for charges including domestic violence, \u201cUse of Dangerous Weapon,\u201d \u201cStrangulation & Suffocation,\u201d \u201cFalse Imprisonment,\u201d and battery.

He was released from probation for this conviction in May of 2020.\n\nThen, in 2018, after Huber was released from prison but still on probation for his 2012 conviction, he was arrested for domestic abuse, disorderly conduct, and battery. He was ultimately convicted and sentenced to probation.\n\nHuber was also caught in possession of drug paraphernalia, which is not a criminal offense in the state of Wisconsin, in 2015.\n\nWhile GoFundMe banned a campaign raising money for Rittenhouse, but recently promoted Huber\u2019s campaign on its official corporate Twitter account.\n\nHuber is one of the two men who did not survive their encounter with Rittenhouse on Tuesday night, succumbing to his injuries.

After the revision to the disclaimer was approved, Hill explained DSHS planned to set up a Collin County work group Aug. 25 that will be committed to rectifying the county\u2019s backlog of cases.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to be working to call everyone who\u2019s on that list that\u2019s currently active to determine whether or not they\u2019re still active or whether or not they\u2019re recovered,\u201d he said.\n\nHill said the work group will be checking whether patients currently classified as active cases of COVID-19 have been symptom-free for 10 days so they can be reclassified as recovered. He also explained that if the group is unable to reach a patient after three attempts, they will be reclassified as recovered.\n\nThe \u201cwork group\u201d consists of 12 private contractors performing an audit of the data.\n\nState officials claimed the inaccurate numbers were due to a \u201cbacklog\u201d that had \u201crecently included some older cases,\u201d a questionable statement given that Collin Co. active case numbers were apparently overstated by over 5600%.\n\n\n\nFlashback: A Collin Co.

Greg Abbott relied on when he advocated face mask wearing, business shutdowns and \u2018social distancing\u2019 across the state.\n\nAccording to an Aug. 16 article by the El Paso Times:\n\n\u201cListen, there\u2019s a reality: People have had an altered state of life for the past few months. One that requires wearing a mask. One that requires staying at home if at all possible. One that reduces your level of [activity] with others,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cThat\u2019s a challenge, a once in a lifetime challenge, and it\u2019s easy to get a sense of fatigue. It\u2019s easy to want to stop having to comply with those standards.\u201d\n\n[\u2026]\n\nAs of Thursday, the Texas Department of State Health Services was reporting 513,575 coronavirus cases in Texas, with an estimated 128,526 active cases.

A Justice for Cannon Hinnant fundraiser page has been set up on GoFundMe, and at press time has accrued roughly $770,000 in donations. The spike in donations over the week is due in no small part to the hashtag #SayHisName, which went viral on social media despite a media blackout. By contrast, the GoFundMe for George Floyd has amassed a staggering $14.7 million in payouts for the Floyd family, and payments continue to pour in. In addition, a mobile hologram that traces Floyd\u2019s name and visage in the sky with garish yellow lighting is slated to tour the United States, replacing historical monuments.

In fact, former FEC chair Michael Toner is warning that the 2020 election could potentially be \u201cBush v. Gore on steroids\u201d\u2026\n\nThe November presidential election is poised to become the most litigated vote in recent U.S. history, according to a former federal election honcho. \u201cThe 2020 election might be Bush v. Gore on steroids,\u201d said Michael Toner, a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission and former chief counsel at the Republican National Committee.\n\nI don\u2019t like the sound of that at all.\n\nWhen that election happened, I was actually going to law school down in Florida, and it was complete and utter madness.\n\nIn the end, Bush\u2019s legal team was superior to Gore\u2019s, and that may have made all the difference.\n\nThis time around, both sides have recruited \u201carmies of volunteer lawyers\u201d in the key battleground states\u2026\n\nPresident Trump and presumptive Democratic nominee Joseph R. Biden\u2019s campaigns have enlisted armies of volunteer lawyers in battleground states and swing districts to fight out close calls on Election Day. Both sides have already filed multiple lawsuits.\n\nThe Biden campaign has been particularly aggressive in rounding up lawyers. At one point, Biden bragged that his campaign had already recruited 600 lawyers\u2026\n\nJoe Biden\u2019s campaign is assembling hundreds of lawyers nationwide to monitor potential voting issues as part of its extensive voter protection efforts heading into the general election. Speaking at a virtual fundraiser Wednesday, the presumptive Democratic nominee said his team has organized 600 lawyers and others across the country to \u201ctry to figure out why the chicanery is likely to take place.\u201d\n\nOne of the fastest ways to ruin anything is to get lawyers involved.\n\nI was once a lawyer, and so I know what I am talking about.\n\nAnd I have a feeling that this election will end up in the hands of the lawyers after election night. I do not believe that either side is going to be willing to concede if the results are remotely close, and earlier this week Hillary Clinton actually said that Joe Biden should not concede \u201cunder any circumstances\u201d\u2026\n\n\u201cJoe Biden should not concede under any circumstances because I think this is going to drag out, and eventually I do believe he will win if we don\u2019t give an inch and if we are as focused and relentless as the other side is,\u201d Clinton said in an excerpt posted Tuesday.\n\nThat certainly sounds quite ominous.\n\nOn multiple occasions, President Trump has also indicated that he may challenge the outcome of the election, and one of the biggest things that he is concerned about are mail-in ballots. The following is what he told \u201cFox and Friends\u201d not too long ago\u2026\n\n\u201cNow with that being said, I have to tell you that if you go with this universal mail-in, where you send millions of votes\u2013in California tens of millions of ballots being sent to everybody and their dogs, okay? Dogs are getting them, okay? People that have been dead for 25 years are getting them\u2013you have to see what\u2019s happening. Then you\u2019re never going to have a fair election.\u201d\n\nIn this case, I think that Trump has a very legitimate point.\n\nIn some states, millions of mail-in ballots are being sent out to voters whether the voters request them or not. That opens a door for all sorts of potential vote fraud, and this is something that alarms me greatly.\n\nIn this election, every single vote in the battleground states is going to matter, and the integrity of the voting process is of paramount importance.\n\nAt first, Joe Biden had built up impressive leads in many of the most important swing states, but now those leads are deteriorating. Just check out the following numbers that pollster Frank Luntz just posted on Twitter\u2026\n\nSwing state polls on August 25th: Pennsylvania \u2022 2016: Hillary +9.2 \u2022 2020: Biden +5.7 Michigan \u2022 2016: Hillary +9.0 \u2022 2020: Biden +6.7 Wisconsin \u2022 2016: Hillary +11.5 \u2022 2020: Biden +6.5 Florida \u2022 2016: Hillary +2.9 \u2022 2020: Biden +4.8\n\nThose numbers should definitely set off alarm bells for Democrats.\n\nAnd today Real Clear Politics has posted four new battleground polls that show how much the race is shifting. One poll shows Biden up by only 3 points in Florida, another has him up by only 2 points in Arizona, a third has him up by only 1 point in North Carolina, and a fourth poll actually has Trump up by 1 point in Wisconsin.\n\nTrump was definitely not supposed to win Wisconsin this time around, and so that should definitely be freaking Democrats out.\n\nSo why are the polls moving in Trump\u2019s direction?\n\nWell, it appears that all of the violence that is going on around the country is backfiring on the Democrats in a major way. Trump is perceived to be the \u201claw and order candidate\u201d, and Biden is making a massive political mistake by not strongly speaking out against the riots that are happening on a nightly basis.\n\nAccording to one recent survey, 59 percent of voters say that violent crime is a \u201cvery important\u201d factor in deciding who to vote for\u2026\n\nThe bedlam is now reflected in the polls, with Americans becoming increasingly concerned about law and order. \u201cA sizable 59 percent of voters in the survey indicate that violent crime, which President Trump has framed as happening in Democrat-controlled cities, is a \u2018very important\u2019 factor in casting their ballots,\u201d writes Rusty Weiss.\n\nAnd Zogby Analytics has just released new numbers that seem to show that the chaos in our major cities is helping Trump significantly\u2026\n\n\u201cAs violent protests and violent crime continue to spike in cities like Chicago, Milwaukee New York City, and Portland, Trump\u2019s standing with urban voters in large cities (59% at least somewhat approved/38% at least somewhat disapproved), and small cities (51% at least somewhat approved/49% at least somewhat disapproved) continues to climb higher.\u201d\n\nIt truly is ironic what we are witnessing. All of these protesters think that they are promoting the cause of \u201csocial justice\u201d, but their actions may be giving us four more years of Trump instead.\n\nAt this point, even CNN\u2019s Don Lemon is realizing that Joe Biden\u2019s inaction on these issues is moving the poll numbers\u2026\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all you. This is where I come in. We\u2019ll get to that. But when you said it\u2019s too little too late, I don\u2019t know about that. I mean, we still have a lot of time left until election day. I do think that this \u2014what you said was happening in Kenosha is a Rorschach test for the entire country. I think this is a blind spot for Democrats. I think Democrats are hoping this will go away, and it\u2019s not going to go away.\u201d \u201cI think maybe Joe Biden may be afraid to do it. I\u2019m not sure. Maybe he won\u2019t, maybe he is. He\u2019s got to address it. He\u2019s got to come out and talk about it. He\u2019s got to do a speech like Barack Obama did about race. He\u2019s got to come out and tell people that he\u2019s going to deal with the issue of police reform in this country, and that\u2019s what\u2019s happening now is happening under Donald Trump\u2019s watch. When he is the president, Kamala Harris is the vice president. Then they will take care of this problem. But guess what? The rioting has to stop. Chris, as you know, and I know it\u2019s showing up in the polling, it\u2019s showing up in focus groups. It is the only thing right now that is sticking.\u201c\n\nIf the election had been held a couple of months ago, Joe Biden probably would have won by a large margin, but now everything is changing.\n\nAt this point it appears that we could have a very tight election with legal challenges that could last for months afterwards. If such a scenario plays out, that could definitely set the stage for the sort of civil unrest that I warn about in my new book.\n\nCould you imagine the national temper tantrum that we would see if Trump has a very, very narrow lead after election night?\n\nOf course the left will pull out every legal trick in the book in order to try to deny Trump a second term, and Trump has his own army of lawyers ready to fight back.\n\nI have a feeling that things are going to get very, very ugly, and that is extremely unfortunate.\n\nThe Everyday Essentials Sale is now live!

Warner rivals the execrable liar-leaker Adam Schiff in his penchant for deceitful grandstanding and underhanded partisan abuse of congressional oversight authority.\n\nSince the committee\u2019s Republicans are decidedly of the RINO/Neocon variety, with nominal chair and GOP quisling Richard Burr now under FBI investigation for insider trading around the coronavirus scare, the Senate\u2019s report concludes the exact opposite of the report issued by the House Intelligence Committee under Chairman Devin Nunes, in the last Congress.\n\nThe coordinated media roll-out of this report, complete with faux-serious statements of \u2018grave concern\u2019 and similarly-contrived alarmist fulminations made to eager anti-Trump media cameras by the committee\u2019s partisan Democrat concern trolls, defeats any presumptions of good faith public interested motives behind its release just weeks from the imminent re-election of President Trump.\n\nThe recycled, long-debunked garbage being pushed in the report has long passed it\u2019s sell-by date, yet they can\u2019t resist another effort to push their \u201cBIG LIE\u201d as it concerns me. The report says, \u201c[t]he Committee assessed that Trump spoke with Stone about WikiLeaks on multiple occasions,\u201d despite the fact that the president said in written answers to the Mueller gang that he did not recall doing so. This \u2018assessment\u2019 is flatly, unequivocally and 100% FALSE.\n\nNotice the report\u2019s convenient use of the hedge word \u201cassessed\u201d. This particularly-unpersuasive word choice is used by intelligence agencies when they seek to push some conclusion for which they have NO evidence or proof, as is the case with their manufactured claim that I ever once communicated with President Trump about WikiLeaks.\n\nI testified to the House Intelligence Committee that I had NOT spoken to candidate Trump or President Trump about the Wikileaks disclosures. The charges brought against me for false statements to that committee did NOT include my testimony refuting any claims that I had ever had such communications with Donald Trump. Further, the Mueller Report never alleged, or otherwise concluded, that the President was not truthful when he likewise said he recalled no such communications.\n\nAggressive as they were, even the Mueller prosecutors knew full well that the only support they could muster to substantiate this fabricated claim was uncorroborated testimony from Michael Cohen and Rick Gates, induced as part of their plea bargains, attempting to avoid prison. Even after seizing all of my communications and devices, and presumably surveilling those of others, perhaps even the President\u2019s, not a single text, email, note or other document was found or produced to contradict the truth that both the President and I told about this question.\n\nThe report also conveniently excludes Cohen\u2019s contradictory testimony on this point. Cohen first said he overheard a call between candidate Trump and me in July of 2016 just before the Democrat National Convention, during which WikiLeaks dropped the first batch of DNC-related documents. Then he changed his story, subsequently claiming he overheard this call in August 2016, just before the Republican National Convention.\n\nCohen\u2019s perjured testimony claimed that candidate Trump put me on speaker phone, after a secretary told him I was on the line. The secretary who routinely handled any calls I made to candidate Trump gave no support to Cohen\u2019s claims \u2013 namely because Cohen\u2019s version of events never happened. Cohen was never called as a witness in my trial, and for good reason \u2013 the claims of this admitted liar have ZERO corroboration.\n\nCuriously, the only other testimony purporting that Donald Trump and I communicated about Wikileaks \u2013 from Rick Gates \u2013 was essentially an identical circumstance, as though the \u201coverhearing a phone call\u201d scenario was the only one that the Mueller gang and their two cooperating plea-bargainers could plausibly fabricate, knowing they had not an iota of hard evidence (a text, email, recording, note etc). Rick Gates testified at my trial that he witnessed Trump take a cell phone call from me while riding with candidate Trump in a SUV from Trump Tower to LaGuardia Airport in August 2016.\n\nGates admitted he did not hear the actual call, claiming only that he knew it was a call from me because he purportedly saw my name pop up on Trump\u2019s cell phone. The fact that Gates was seated in the back of SUV, while Trump rode in the front seat, casts doubt on this claim, and Gates never explained how he could have so readily glimpsed anything on Trump\u2019s phone, in the instant Trump would have looked down at the phone and picked up the call, putting the phone up to his ear.\n\nFurther, I\u2019ve had the same cell phone number for many years and it has always been held under my company, which is what pops up from Caller ID whenver I call someone from it, i.e. even if Gates somehow could see the screen, it would not have displayed my name.\n\nGates also said there were two Secret Service Agents in the car at the time, but conveniently for Gates and his fictional testimony, the Government could not produce them, nor could it even produce a phone record to show such a call ever happened. Gates claimed that he knew the call pertained to Wikileaks because of something Trump said immediately after the call, but then claimed elsewhere that Trump\u2019s comment was made much later, after they had boarded Trump\u2019s plane.\n\nThe bottom line is that Gates\u2019 fictional overheard call between candidate Trump and me simply never happened. But Gates got what he needed in exchange for fabricating a conveniently \u201coverheard call\u201d (which no one else apparently overheard): a mere 45-day sentence and a free pass from the Mueller gang on a million dollar tax evasion charge. Regardless, Gates\u2019s tall tale, like Cohen\u2019s, is uncorroborated \u2013 the result of an extremely-desirable benefit accruing to Gates: avoiding serious prison time.\n\nThese two fabricated, uncorroborated plea bargain-induced stories of supposed eavesdropping (without actually hearing anything) are regularly used to bolster the BIG LIE. The BIG LIE goes like this: Roger Stone traded his silence regarding his knowledge of misconduct by the president in return for the president\u2019s commutation of his sentence.\u201d\n\nWhat makes this defamatory falsehood especially underhanded and malicious is that it was concocted out of my public statements that I would never trade false testimony against the president instigated from me by the Special Counsel lawyers for some sort of prosecutorial leniency or plea deal from Mueller.\n\nWhen I repeatedly and accurately said that Mueller\u2018s dirty cops attempted to pressure me into bearing false witness against the president, but that I flatly refused and further said that I would never do so, the Democrat disinformation spinmeisters deceitfully twisted this into an insinuation that I somehow secured clemency by my refusal to implicate Donald Trump. Funny they express no concern, or even merely acknowledge it as real possibility, that doing so would require my testifying falsely.\n\nAs the Trump-deranged Democrats and their media propagandists have shown over and over and over, there is no lie or fabrication they would ever decry or condemn or even deem wrong, as long as it is harmful in any way to Donald Trump. Conversely, there is no truth, no matter how incontrovertible or obvious, that they will ever accept, as long as it affirms or validates Donald Trump, or more precisely if it in any contradicts their militant, seeting hatred and utterly-warped villainization towards him.\n\nOne need not look past the players behind this disinformation campaign concerning my refusal to testify to Special Counsel-induced lies about the president to see this derangement in its fullest expression. The warped originator of it is Andrew Weissman, who now can be seen regularly spouting outright Trump hate on MSNBC, just another zealot among its malignant peanut gallery of arrogant pseudo-intellects. Weissmann\u2019s bull was then picked up and repeated by Adam (bull)Schiff, and eventually by those paragons of truth and integrity Jerry Nadler, Hillary Clinton and Eric Swalwell. Its bogus recycling by the Senate Intelligence committee is just the latest ploy to sandbag their BIG LIE with yet another worthless D.C. establishment paper blizzard.\n\nWith the top tier disinformation peddlers giving them their cues, the second and third stringers then pile on to repeat and reinforce the lie. This was evident when suddenly dozens of leftist law professors, attorneys and legal \u201cexperts\u201d popped up with half-baked op-eds pushing the same crackpot theory: \u201cthe President\u2019s commutation of Stone\u2019s sentence was tainted because Trump was acting to hide his own misconduct\u201d. Their legal contortions and deceitful distortions of the facts, like their conclusions, are simply WRONG.\n\nThe president commuted my sentence as an act of both justice and mercy. He believed, with plenty of factual and legal support in plain view for all to see, that I did not get a fair trial. He also saw that, contrary to judicial precedent in every district in the US court system and contrary to the current policy of the DOJ/BOP, I was being ordered to surrender at 67 years old and with asthma to a federal correctional facility that had substantial numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases. He realized that this \u201cspecial (mis) treatment\u201d amount to essentially a death sentence. These were more than enough to warrant his clemency, and his act of clemency had nothing whatsoever to do with some exchange for my \u201csilence\u201d, a deal that exists only in the fevered, malicious imaginations of Trump (or Stone) haters.\n\n\n\nHoward Fineman of MSNBC even tried to get into the act, claiming I had somehow earned clemency by remaining silent, based on a telephone conversation with me. Of course, the duplicitous MSNBC has-been tried to justify himself in a text message to me saying that he never intended to make such a claim, admitting it was not consistent with our conversation. This little episode with Fineman was reported by the Gateway Pundit.\n\nAs an exercise in overkill, the Senate Intelligence Committee report includes 1098 references to me in either the body of the report or the footnotes, with virtually all of them incorrect, including this whopper: \u201cIn July 2016, Stone drafted tweets for Trump \u2014 at his request \u2014 that \u201cattacked Clinton for her adversarial posture toward Russia and mentioned a new peace deal with Putin.\u201d It is beyond even my imagination to conceive who would have made this claim because I wrote no tweets for Donald Trump, including the one referred to here.\n\nThe phony Senate Intel report also asserted that \u201c[t]he committee also found \u201csignificant evidence\u201d to suggest that WikiLeaks was \u201cknowingly collaborating with Russian government officials.\u201d They must have lost it after they \u201cfound\u201d such evidence, because it has yet to be forthcoming, from this committee or anywhere else. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has long denied, quite vigorously, that the source of the hacked emails was Russia. In fact, Assange has further stated with equal vigor that the source was not any state or state agent at all.\n\nThe committee\u2019s loose smear of Wikileaks as some Russian stooge is simply reverse engineered from the desired conclusion they began their investigation with, as their guiding foundation \u2013 the dubious presumption that \u201cthe Russians hacked the DNC and used Wikileaks to disseminate the stolen data\u201d. The problem with this little chestnut is that declassified documents now prove that this claim has literally no basis whatsoever other than a draft redacted memo that Crowdstrike prepared for the DNC, a memo which Crowdstrikes\u2019 own executives have now debunked in sworn testimony.\n\nTaking a step back from all this hair-splitting spin and disinformation, dressed-up as some sort of objective, non-(or \u201cbi\u201d)-partisan Senate investigation, the political landscape provides the real context for this presidential election-eve stunt. It is all too clear that there is now an impending unraveling of the Obama-Clinton-Biden illegal political spying operation conducted against presidential candidate Donald Trump in 2016 and carried over by the same subversives against President of the United States Donald Trump, well into 2017.\n\nIt is the ensuing collapse of this corrupt house of cards spying scheme, which involved truly criminal \u2013 seditious \u2013 misconduct by top Obama administration officials that has prompted this last ditch effort to salvage the spectacular public flop that was the 2-year multi-million dollar rogue \u201cSpecial Counsel\u201d witch hunt lynch mob conducted against President Trump\u2019s political allies by legal mercenaries handpicked from the Obama-Clinton-Biden cesspool of Democrat lawyers.\n\nThese corrupt players know that their crimes are too large to forever be obscured by all of the exaggerated hysteria and deceitful mischaracterizations they have spent years peddling about legal opposition efforts to expose the truth about their epically-corrupt presidential wannabe and her endlessly-sleazy retinue of partisan hacks and hatchetweasels.\n\nThe fact is that, for all their endless, breathless media hyping to bolster its credibility and justify its meandering secretive crusade, the \u201cSpecial Counsel\u201d operation was only fronted by its incessantly-lionized figurehead Robert Mueller. Behind the file footage Mueller facade it was actually run by corrupt partisan Democrat lawyer Andrew Weissmann, It was not \u201cRepublican war hero\u201d Mueller, but sleazy Democrat errand boy Weissmann who marshaled a rat\u2019s nest of Obama-Clinton loyalists to pose as prosecutors, spending nearly two years targeting a small group of key advisors and supporters of Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nWith nearly-unlimited investigative resources at its disposal, a small army of malicious Democrat partisan lawyers making up its ranks, and effectively no actual oversight or adult supervision from the \u201cacting\u201d Attorney General or any other sufficiently-empowered official within the DOJ, Weissmann and his flunkies perpetrated an \u201cinvestigation\u201d that three months into its existence had already established conclusively that there was, in fact, no \u201cRussian collusion\u201d and zero criminal predicates to justify the promulgation of any prosecutions against anyone associated with Donald Trump\u2019s wildly-successful presidential campaign.\n\nNot ones to be deterred by the non-existence of any crimes they could prosecute in connection with Donald Trump\u2019s spectacular pummeling of their political godmother, the Weissmann vendetta operation persisted with general warrant style targeting of select high-profile targets associated with the 2016 Trump Campaign, notably only individuals who had not become federal government employees in the wake of the Democrat-career-shattering Trump triumph.\n\nAfter a full year of coming up short in their quest to settle the score for their failed would-be political patroness, while also providing cover to their corrupt cronies who criminally abused extraordinary spying powers against the current president at the behest of his predecessor (their now-fading political messiah) the imperative to manufacture any sort of malicious prosecution they could grew more and more acute.\n\nEven if it meant finally conceding that there was absolutely nothing they could contort or contrive out of the Trump Campaign\u2019s activities sufficient to manufacture a criminal case to slake their vengeance through some abusive prosecution, the Special Counsel Weissmann gang was bound and determined to lynch them at least one high-profile Trump Republican. That turned out to be me.\n\nAs a last resort they set about to backtrack with a fine-tooth-comb through the course of the larger \u201cRussia! Russia!! Russia!!!\u201d witch hunt, of which they were but one terror cell, to cherry pick any sort of process offense they could possibly extract from its mindless, fruitless consumption of public resources and airtime. Or perhaps they could exaggerate and sensationalize some fleeting inconsequential circumstance unearthed from somewhere in their dragnet haul of private communications from one of their preferred targets that could be shoehorned to fit the elements of some criminal offense.\n\nWhatever their tactics were to cobble together any sort of criminal offenses they could possibly contrive to prop up their phony ulterior-motivated crusade to substantiate their partisan fantasies of busting up some Russian collusion conspiracy, in the end their Russian collusion conspiracy theory was just that \u2013 a pure fantasy.\n\nNow, the thinnest residue leftover from the Special Counsel\u2019s spectacularly-failed attempt to justify its rogue existence has been meticulously cataloged and deceitfully inflated into huge chunks of a 966-page Senate Intelligence Committee exercise in generating sheafs of written material having such profound credibility and relevance that it warrants immediate and wholesale consignment to the circular file.\n\nIn sum, for all its meticulous organization the committee\u2019s report is merely a more voluminous regurgitation of the same tortured insinuations and deceitful evidentiary spin that this committee\u2019s equally-compromised predecessors spent more than three years manufacturing from behind the fraudulent facade of a legitimate meritorious investigation.\n\nThe Democrat Russian collusion conspiracy theorists on the Senate Intelligence Committee are clearly eager to squander whatever vestigial credibility still attached to their august body from a long-gone era in which it was not so easily degenerated into a cheap tool of even cheaper partisan gameplaying.\n\nWhat is obvious from this latest iteration in the disingenuous pursuit of mythical Russian boogeymen presumed to have colluded somehow with Donald Trump and his campaign in 2016, is that it bears the same illegitimate ulterior motives as other previous Russian collusion witch hunts.\n\nTheir first motive is to distract the public\u2019s attention and divert political heat away from the real corruption and the real Russian collusion that Democrat politicians and operatives had perpetrated both during and after the 2016 election.\n\nTheir second motive is to damage and defame President Trump and his associates by any means necessary, until he is driven from office.\n\nThe third motive, though it is rather moot this far down-sewer, is to establish false pretexts to obtain warrants, or some other legal justification, to surveil, search and seize the sensitive political and personal communications of targeted adversaries.\n\nIn the final analysis, this committee\u2019s report stands as an officious attempt to prop up the runny pile of political mud that is the sum total substance of the Obama-Clinton-Biden junta\u2019s multi-year attempt to gaslight the American public in order to wage a ruthless malicious smear campaign against a sitting president.\n\nIf nothing else, this report provides a detailed compendium of the elaborate disinformation that was contrived and propagated by corrupt Obama administration officials and Clinton-loyal apparatchiks, who effectively acted as partisan political operatives while holding sworn positions in federal law enforcement and in the intelligence \u201ccommunity.\u201d\n\nThese are the sort of serious, brazen crimes that don\u2019t require a two-year $30M fine tooth comb job by partisan pencil pushers, nor a 966-page report, to be taken seriously\u2026and vigorously prosecuted like the grotesque betrayals of trust and abuses of power they represent.\n\n\n\nThank the brave reporters who gathered this footage.\n\nThe Everyday Essentials Sale is now live!

The multiple lines of evidence for dark matter in the galaxy are robust and unaffected by our work.\u201d\n\nFar from considering the team\u2019s findings to be discouraging, Abazajian said they should encourage physicists to focus on concepts other than the most popular ones.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of alternative dark matter candidates out there,\u201d he said. \u201cThe search is going to be more like a fishing expedition where you don\u2019t already know where the fish are.\u201d\n\nThe Everyday Essentials Sale is now live!

A lot of people take this as a sign of a strengthening economy. Peter Schiff begs to differ. In his podcast, he argued that surging homes sales are actually a sign of a weak economy.\n\nSingle-family new home sales rose 14% between June and July to an annual rate of 901,000, according to Commerce Department data. Sales were up 36% on a yearly basis.\n\nThis comes on the heels of a 24.7% spike in existing home sales, according to National Realtors Association data that came out last week.\n\nAs Peter pointed out in his podcast, you have to go back to housing bubble days to find a bigger month for new home sales. Is this because the economy is booming right now?\n\n\u201cNo. It\u2019s got nothing to do with a booming economy. In fact, one of the reasons so many new homes are being bought is because the economy is so weak that mortgage rates are down at two-and-a-half percent.\u201d\n\nThere is also a dark side in the housing market that is not being discussed. Even as people buy houses, many more are in danger of losing theirs. The overall delinquency rate for mortgages on one-to-four-unit residential properties spiked by nearly 4% in Q2, reaching 8.22% as of June 30, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association\u2019s National Delinquency Survey. The jump in the delinquency rate was the biggest quarterly rise in the history of the survey.\n\nWolf Street summed up the situation.\n\n\u201cThis mess playing out in the mortgage market has been largely swept under the rug of widespread, government-supported forbearance programs \u2013 to where no one really knows what will happen to those mortgages when these forbearance programs end. And the exuberance in other parts of the real estate industry, such as with homebuilders, and even with mortgage brokers and mortgage lenders that arrange refi and purchase mortgages, is a contradiction to what is going on with these swept-under-rug delinquencies that will eventually come to a head.\u201d\n\nThat contradiction is being fueled by Federal Reserve monetary policy. In effect, lenders are giving away money to buy homes. Keep in mind, you can still deduct mortgage interest from your income taxes. That means for those who itemize deductions, the net after-tax cost of the money will fall below 2%.\n\n\u201cThat is below even the Fed\u2019s official inflation rate. Now, the actual inflation rate is well north of that. But here, you could borrow money to buy a house for less than the annual inflation rate that we have now. \u2026 So, this is a great trade.\u201d\n\nPeter said the real loser in all of this will be the lenders \u2013 the banks. The government can guarantee mortgages so they will get paid. But the government can\u2019t guarantee that the dollars used to repay that mortgage will have any real value.\n\nSo, what does this mean? If we\u2019re going to load up American banks with 30-year mortgages at 2.5%, what happens when interest rates go up?\n\n\u201cWe are setting up our financial system for a complete implosion. The banks are going to fail. Anybody that owns these mortgages \u2014 pension plans, endowments \u2014 this is going to be a complete disaster. Yes, it\u2019s a windfall for the debtor, but it\u2019s a disaster for the creditor. And a lot of Americans are creditors that don\u2019t even know it. But our whole financial system is going to implode like a house of cards because of these low mortgages.\u201d\n\nNot only is the government guaranteeing mortgages, so is the Federal Reserve. The central bank is guaranteeing that you pay an insane, artificially low interest rate. So, even though home prices are rising to record levels and the cost of building new homes is rising as well, it doesn\u2019t matter so much when you can borrow at 2.5%.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s only because the economy is lousy that you can get a mortgage this cheap, which is the only reason people are able to buy.\u201d\n\nLow mortgage rates are allowing people to buy homes, but that doesn\u2019t explain why so many people are buying homes. Peter goes on to talk about that, saying they are moving out of the cities and high-tax states.\n\nIn this podcast, Peter also breaks down some more data revealing the economy isn\u2019t rushing toward recovery and talked about the Fed\u2019s Jackson Hole symposium.\n\n\n\nKnow your history or be doomed to repeat it!\n\nThe Everyday Essentials Sale is now live!

It\u2019s really about individual differences, irrespective of age,\u201d said Chris Barry, a WSU psychology professor and the lead author on the study. \u201cWe expected FoMO to be higher in younger age groups, particularly because of the tremendous amount of social development happening at those times, but that\u2019s not what we found.\u201d\n\nBarry and co-author Megan Wong, a WSU undergraduate student, conducted a survey of more than 400 people across the United States from different age cohorts ranging from 14 to 47, asking a range of questions related to self-perception, life satisfaction and social media use.\n\nThe researchers found that social media use was not a good predictor of FoMO. For instance, two people with the same social media engagement may be affected quite differently: one might have few negative feelings about seeing their friends\u2019 activities while the other might find it upsetting.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not all equally prone to the Fear of Missing Out, but for those who are, social media can exacerbate it,\u201d said Barry. \u201cSocial media allows you to witness what other people are doing and what\u2019s going on in their lives. If there\u2019s already concern about missing out, then there will be distress at seeing that on social media.\u201d\n\nFor people experiencing this kind of distress, Barry suggested that it may be good to reduce social media use or cut it off altogether for a period of time.\n\nThe study did find one silver-lining: while FoMO can have negative impacts, it did not appear to relate to the respondents\u2019 sense of life satisfaction. Barry said this indicates that FoMO is not an overwhelming social anxiety.\n\nThe researchers suggest that those who want to reduce their feelings of FoMO should try addressing their negative self-perceptions such as practicing better self-compassion by viewing personal setbacks as opportunities for growth, taking steps to reduce loneliness and shifting focus away from the distant experiences of others.\n\n\u201cTo do something about FoMO, individuals can foster a greater sense of real connectedness to others which will lessen feelings of isolation. You can also try being more in the moment, concentrating on what is in front of you as opposed to focusing on what else is going on out there,\u201d Barry said.\n\n\n\nKnow your history or be doomed to repeat it!\n\nThe Everyday Essentials Sale is now live!

The video suggests he may indeed have had a knife, and had ignored orders to drop it, before being shot.\n\nIt also suggested that Blake\u2019s girlfriend lied to police when she claimed he hadn\u2019t been hostile.\n\nAnother witness filmed part of the encounter between Kenosha police and Blake on his cell phone from across the street, but that video didn\u2019t show any scuffle with police.\n\n* * *\n\nUpdate (0950ET): Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth held another press conference Wednesday morning to discuss the deadly shootings, and other crimes committed across the city during a third night of violence.\n\nThe Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported that police expect to make an arrest in a case stemming from the shootings \u201csoon\u201d, and that the FBI has been \u201cassisting\u201d local investigators, implying that the shooter will likely be taken into custody.\n\nNo one has been apprehended, but Beth said he believed at least one person would be taken into custody soon based on video footage police have reviewed. \u201cI feel very confident we\u2019ll have him in a very short time,\u201d Beth said.\n\nBeth attributed the progress to the \u201cresources\u201d provided by the FBI.\n\nThe investigation of the latest shooting is being conducted by the Kenosha Police Department with the assistance of the FBI, Beth said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of resources that are helping us pull this stuff together,\u201d Beth said of the shooting investigation.\n\nRoughly 250 law enforcement officers and 250 National Guard members were on hand Tuesday night to try and quell the unrest, and property damage was much less intense during the third night of unrest \u2013 however, clashes between militia groups and hard-core progressive groups that resembled street violence appeared to play out in the streets of Kenosha.\n\nThe shooting took place right in the heart of the city, according to MJS.\n\nThe incident happened on Sheridan Road in the heart of Kenosha near the Froedert South hospital building. Many people were still on the streets in protest just before the shooting, walking up and down Sheridan Road, where protesters had been driven after being expelled from Civic Center Park.\n\nHere are some more interesting tidbits from the report.\n\nA Journal Sentinel reporter earlier in the evening observed a group of armed men with long guns standing guard at a dry cleaning business on Sheridan Road near 59th Street, some on the roof. Police told them to get off the roof and a person shouted back: \u201cOfficer, this is our business.\u201d Police did not ultimately order them off the roof. Police did not ultimately make them get off the roof. [\u2026] It is unclear if the men seen by the reporter were members of the Kenosha Guard, or whether Beth, in his comments, was referring to that group, or similar groups of people. Before the shooting, someone from Kenosha suggested to Beth that he deputize ordinary citizens to help contain the unrest. Beth said he refused. \u201cI said, \u2018There\u2019s no way I\u2019m doing that,'\u201d Beth said.\n\nMeanwhile, GOP Senator Ron Johnson, who represents Wisconsin in the Senate alongside Democrat Tammy Baldwin (who hasn\u2019t said much of anything), urged Democratic Gov Tony Evers to accept President Trump\u2019s offer for federal reinforcements.\n\n* * *\n\nAlready, the riots in Kenosha inspired by the police shooting of unarmed Jacob Blake, who was shot in the back while trying to enter a car with his children in the back seat (Blake was hit by 4 of the 7 shots, some reports said he had been armed at one point), have led to the deaths of at least 2 people.\n\nDespite the governor\u2019s decision to declare a state of emergency after a second night of violence, police and the national guard were once again largely absent in a stream of horrifying video from last night\u2019s riots, which at times devolved into open street warfare between groups of rioters and armed people allegedly there to protect property.\n\nSeveral videos of at least one of the fatal shootings flooded Twitter last night.\n\nAlso in the news Kenosha, WI\n\nMAYOR AND GOV refuse National Guard help\u2026 Ian Miles Cheong (@stillgray) Tweeted:\n\nExtended footage of the shooting in Kenosha. pic.twitter.com/ErI52KOgNQ \u2014 Kirsten W (@QTEAM1776) August 26, 2020\n\nGuy in Kenosha got his arm turned to Swiss cheese chasing down a dude with an AR-15 pic.twitter.com/cwlHtAoZUA \u2014 Mike Roagreser (@BTogetherAlone) August 26, 2020\n\nWhile video of the other, allegedly involving the same shooter, who was confronted by several other armed citizens.\n\nExtremely graphic: Someone at the #KenoshaRiots was just shot in the head. @livesmattershow was there to record it. pic.twitter.com/dH1t5M4AIK \u2014 Andy Ng\u00f4 (@MrAndyNgo) August 26, 2020\n\nPolice confirmed to the press that they responded to two fatal shootings and at least one non-fatal shooting during the third night of protests inspired by the shooting of Blake.\n\nEvers said he authorized 250 Wisconsin National Guard troops to protect critical infrastructure and assist Kenosha authorities, but once again, these reinforcements stayed clear of local businesses and offered almost no assistance in the protection of private property.\n\nKenosha officials said another 100 law enforcement officers from surrounding areas were brought in to assist local police. An 8pm curfew was in effect for the area.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to work with local, state and federal law enforcement in holding those criminals who are destroying our city responsible,\u201d Kenosha Mayor John Antamarian said in a statement.\n\nAnd former NYC Mayor Rudy Giuliani had a response.\n\nKenosha, Wisconsin another city governed by pandering Democrats is burning to the ground.

Giuliani (@RudyGiuliani) August 26, 2020\n\nKenosha police said early Wednesday that they had responded to a report of multiple gunshots just before midnight. Authorities said two people were killed in the shooting, and a third gunshot victim was transported to the hospital with serious, a story that is more or less consistent with the videos we shared above.\n\nAn investigation into the shooting is reportedly ongoing. Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth told the NYT that police are investigating whether the shooting resulted from a conflict between demonstrators and a group of armed men there to protect local businesses. CNN reported that armed riot police fired tear gas and pepper spray into the crowd, while Blake\u2019s family pleaded for calm on Tuesday.\n\nOne Twitter user shared what she alleged was an interview with the shooter (who can be seen above being chased by another man with a gun) from before the attack. In the interview he can be heard saying he is armed with live ammunition.\n\nThe protests have triggered gatherings of armed citizens, some of whom said they were protecting property against looting. Videos shared widely on social media have shown storefront after storefront ablaze, along with dozens of cars \u2013 rampant, indefensible, mayhem. And if the government won\u2019t stop it \u2013 for whatever reason \u2013 sometimes people take responsibility into their own hands, which is one of the reasons the second amendment was enshrined in the constitution via the Bill of Rights.\n\nThe Everyday Essentials Sale is now live!

Doug Jones of Alabama and Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee \u2014 spoke to the union about fighting the outsourcing, the same number as Republicans who did so. Cohen requested that House Democratic leadership include, in a coronavirus relief bill, \u201clanguage that prohibits federal government agencies, including the TVA, from privatizing federal jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d but no such language ever materialized. [Emphasis added]\n\n\u201cWhat follows is a dark lesson about what happens when the Left ignores its historic commitment to workers,\u201d Stafford wrote, calling Trump\u2019s action against TVA \u201ca material victory for a small but not insignificant number of American workers.\u201d\n\nStafford continued:\n\nAnd just like that, Trump had saved two hundred union workers at one of the last bastions of the New Deal\u2019s legacy, and during an unprecedented global crisis to boot. An easier political victory for such a loathed figure would be hard to find. And worse, for the first time in months, the polls for November\u2019s presidential election are suddenly tightening. [Emphasis added]\n\nSurveys and poll taken this year show the public is overwhelmingly on Trump\u2019s side of the labor issue as majorities continue to oppose corporation\u2019s outsourcing of American jobs to imported foreign workers.\n\nWhile tens of millions of Americans remain jobless and underemployed, nearly 60 percent of American adults told Ipsos pollsters in July that they want to halt foreign visa worker programs \u2014 such as the H-1B visa \u2014 so that Americans are prioritized for jobs. In June, a majority of Americans, including black Americans, said there is no labor shortage.\n\nAside from ordering all federal agencies to conduct internal audits to clarify that they are not displacing American workers with imported foreign visa workers, Trump has halted the H-1B, H-2B, H-4, L-1, and J-1 visa programs to give job priority to unemployed Americans. The State Department has sought to poke loopholes in the order.\n\nAt the Republican National Convention (RNC) this week, Trump said one of his main priorities is \u201cquickly returning to full employment\u201d and invited many of the TVA workers to the speech.\n\nEvery year, the U.S. admits about 1.2 million legal immigrants on green cards to permanently resettle in the country. In addition, another 1.4 million foreign workers are admitted every year to take American jobs. Often, Americans are fired and replaced by visa workers. Many are forced to train their foreign replacements.\n\nIn June 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court reaffirmed the president\u2019s control over legal immigration. In Trump v. Hawaii, the court stated that presidents have extraordinarily broad discretion to admit or exclude foreign nationals from the U.S. when they believe doing so is in the national interest.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Australia\u2019s leftist opposition Labor Party has indicated support for the law, meaning it will likely pass.\n\nAlthough officials have not specifically mentioned China in proposing the new law, observers say the main motivation behind the bill is the Australian government\u2019s concern that states and universities have been entering into agreements with Chinese entities at great risk to national security. In 2019, the Australian state of Victoria signed a deal with Beijing to join its infrastructure-building Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which the Chinese Communist Party uses to expand its sphere of influence.

Women who became pregnant a second time were forced to abort. If caught pregnant late in their term, the government would still kill their child. An estimated 400 million births were \u201cprevented\u201d between 1979 and 2015 when dictator Xi Jinping expanded the policy to allow two children in the wake of a precipitous decline in the national birth rate. \u201cPrevented\u201d includes abortions and infanticides, particularly of baby girls, as boys were more traditionally desirable for couples and those who had girls chose to kill them and try again for a boy. Many abandoned infants in open-air markets, where they would die and rot in public.\n\nA feature in the Atlantic last year discussed the One Child Nation documentary, which includes interviews with an 84-year-old Chinese mid-wife, Huaru Yuan, who said she has performed \u201c50,000 to 60,000 sterilizations and abortions.\u201d\n\nThe Atlantic reported some of the gruesome details from the film:\n\nAs One Child Nation continues, the trail of horrors it depicts becomes long and winding. When China opened its doors to international adoption in 1992, many state-run orphanages became sites for human trafficking. Through her interviews, Wang learns about how newborns from families who violated the policy were kidnapped by family-planning officials and sold to orphanages, a detail that was repressed by the government (in the film, Wang speaks with a journalist who was eventually forced to flee to Hong Kong because of his reporting). To this day, many adoptees\u2014and their families\u2014find learning the truth about their origins nearly impossible. A significant number of the babies sold were abandoned by their families or given to \u201cmatchmakers\u201d for adoption. Many of the infants were girls given up by parents who hoped instead for a male child to carry on the family name. In one scene, Wang\u2019s uncle recalls the loss of his newborn daughter, who was left on a meat counter in a market and died two days later when no one took her. Another of Wang\u2019s relatives talks about how she gave away her own daughter to a human trafficker, fearing the child would die if abandoned.

Another of Wang\u2019s relatives talks about how she gave away her own daughter to a human trafficker, fearing the child would die if abandoned.\n\nChina changed its one-child policy to a two-child policy in 2015. Forced abortions and infanticide continue, as detailed in the 2017 annual report of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), led by Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Chris Smith.\n\nThe Charlotte Lozier Institute reported on the revelations:\n\nThe report confirms that population planning regulations continue to exist at the provincial level that \u201cinstruct officials to carry out abortions, often referred to as \u2018remedial measures\u2019 (bujiu cuoshi), for \u2018out-of-plan\u2019 pregnancies.\u201d The report cites family planning regulations from Jiangxi and Hubei provinces and the Shenzhen municipality. Also noted are official reports from local government authorities which state that women are compelled to undergo the \u201cfour procedures\u201d which are IUD insertion, sterilization, first trimester abortion, and mid- to late-term abortion. This is cited for the following: Gu County, Guichi District, Yunyang District, Wolong District, and Dongshahe Township. Other reports have found this same abuse. The State Department\u2019s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2016 also found that coerced abortions continue to take place under China\u2019s revised Population and Family Planning Law. The law states that a citizen\u2019s \u201clawful rights\u201d should not be violated in enforcing the family planning policy, yet the State Department\u2019s report indicates that these rights are not clearly specified in the law. Also, there are seven activities listed in the law which are prohibited when officials implement the birth limit, and forced abortion is not one of them. The report notes there are regulations in Hunan, Hubei, and Liaoning provinces which require women to terminate pregnancies not in compliance with the law and confirms that these regulations have been enforced.\n\nReggie Littlejohn, founder and president of Women\u2019s Rights Without Frontiers, spoke about China\u2019s two-child policy in an interview in 2017:\n\nYes, China is not the only place where gendercide happens. But there are things that are unique to China. The main one is the coercive population control. For decades, there\u2019s been the One-Child Policy. Now China has modified its policy from a One-Child Policy to a Two-Child Policy, but the way the Chinese government announced that was very misleading. They stated that they had \u201cabandoned\u201d the One-Child Policy. The mainstream media really picked up on that word, and now people think that all coercive population control in China is over, and that\u2019s not true. They just switched it from a One-Child Policy to a Two-Child Policy. So that now every couple in China is allowed to have two children. What does that mean? That means that the entire infrastructure of surveillance and coercion are still there. Women are still having quarterly pregnancy checks to make sure that they\u2019re not illegally pregnant. They can still require a waiting period between the first child and the second child. And if you get pregnant during the waiting period, you can still be subject to forced abortion. Children can still be forcibly aborted. We had some cases that came out of China last year, 2016, where women were subject to forced abortion of third children.

Well, that is about as un-American and tyrannical as you could possibly imagine. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re dealing with on the left, and it provokes a response.\u201d\n\nCuccinelli continued, \u201cIf law enforcement is incapable of dealing with it, the sort of American culture of do-it-yourselfism is going to assert itself, along with gun ownership, and everything else as we saw in Kenosha, and that\u2019s what will grow, and that isn\u2019t good for anybody.

I wish Governor Evers had moved more in faster, because it\u2019s rather obvious, I think, that the numbers he was bringing weren\u2019t quite up to the task. But he talked to the president, [and] the president was very emphatic in pushing him harder and telling him [that] we\u2019ll provide federal support [and] bring guard from other states, but it has to be with the agreement of the home governor.\u201d\n\nHe then linked Evers\u2019 delayed acceptance of federal security help to Tuesday\u2019s shooting in Kenosha. \u201cOn day one of the president\u2019s conversation with Governor Evers, that didn\u2019t go anywhere, and then you had the shootings that night, proving \u2014 unfortunately \u2014 the president right in some of the worst ways possible.\u201d\n\nViolence begets more violence, held Cuccinelli, warning of a momentum to violent unrest if riots are not stopped.\n\nCuccinelli stated, \u201cThe reality is, if this sort of violence is allowed to fester, it escalates. It\u2019s an invitation to escalation.\u201d He described Kenosha as an \u201cEverytown, USA kind of a place.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf this can blow up [in Kenosha], it can blow up anywhere, and unfortunately some of the viciousness we\u2019re seeing across so much of the left tells us that these people with these tyrannical, violent, vicious tendencies \u2014 and communist ideology, frankly \u2014 are all over the country,\u201d Cuccinelli concluded.\n\nBreitbart News Daily broadcasts live on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. Eastern.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/radio/2020/08/28/cuccinelli-gun-ownership-will-rise-democrat-dont-end-violence/", "published": "2020-08-28T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Bellevue, WA: 46 Arrested or Charged for 'Well-Organized' Looting in May", "text": "Bellevue, Washington, police announced Thursday that 46 individuals have been arrested or were charged in connection to looting during May\u2019s Black Lives Matter riots.\n\nKING 5 News reports:\n\nDozens of looters broke into Bellevue Square mall and other downtown businesses while demonstrators protested the death of George Floyd nearby on May 31.

Michael Waltz (R-FL) announced Friday that he, along with Reps. Stephanie Murphy (D-FL) and Dan Crenshaw (R-TX), received a letter from Pentagon Secretary Mark Esper agreeing that Cashe deserves to have his Silver Star upgraded to the Medal of Honor, the nation\u2019s highest combat award for valor for his heroism in October 2005.\n\nCashe was deployed to Iraq in 2005 when his fighting vehicle hit an improvised explosive device and caught fire. Cashe escaped the vehicle but returned repeated times to pull soldiers out of the flames, while he himself caught on fire and was exposed to enemy gunfire. Cashe later died of his wounds.\n\nVeterans on the right and the left have long pushed for his Silver Star to be upgraded to the Medal of Honor, but it will not be until the Trump administration where it will likely now happen.\n\nEsper said in the letter that he reviewed a proposal by Waltz, Murphy, and Crenshaw to upgrade Cashe\u2019s Silver Star and agreed that his actions merit award of the Medal of Honor.\n\nEsper said that since the award must be awarded within five years after the date of the act justifying the award, Congress will need to first waive the limit. After that, he will provide his endorsement to Trump, and then the \u201cfinal award authority\u201d rests solely with the president.\n\nBreitbart News reached out to the White House for comment but has not received a response. However, it is unlikely that Trump will not decide to award Cashe the Medal of Honor.\n\nWaltz and Crenshaw already offered a successful floor amendment to the fiscal year 2020 National Defense Authorization Act to waive the statute of limitations for Cashe\u2019s Silver Star to be upgraded to the Medal of Honor.\n\n\u201cAlwyn Cashe\u2019s extraordinary courage on behalf of his fellow soldiers, in the face of danger and death, embodies everything the Medal of Honor represents,\u201d said Waltz.\n\n\u201cCashe is a Florida and American hero. He without a doubt deserves our nation\u2019s highest honor \u2014 and I\u2019m very glad Secretary Esper and our Department of Defense agree and recognize his heroic actions. Now Congress needs to act to waive the five-year statute of limitations and allow the Department of Defense\u2019s recommendation to move forward and proceed to the President to give final approval,\u201d he added.\n\nMurphy said in a statement, \u201cAlwyn was a hero in the purest and most profound sense. He gave his own life to save the lives of his fellow soldiers.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am overjoyed that the Secretary of Defense has determined that SFC Cashe\u2019s actions merit the Medal of Honor, a conclusion I strongly share. I will work with my colleagues to swiftly grant the President the authority he needs to provide this valiant soldier with the recognition he earned,\u201d she said.\n\nCrenshaw added, \u201cHeroes are all around us but certain heroes stand out. One of those heroes is Sergeant First Class Alwyn Cashe. Alwyn Cashe\u2019s actions saved his men\u2019s lives. He risked his own life as he pulled them out of a flaming Bradley Fighting Vehicle and went back \u2013 again and again.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom Secretary Esper\u2019s statement, we are poised to fully recognize the full extent of his heroism by finally awarding him the Medal of Honor, our nation\u2019s highest military award for bravery on the battlefield,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is a hero and his story is one all Americans should know so we can look upon his example and aspire to the example he displayed.\u201d\n\nFollow Breitbart News\u2019s Kristina Wong on Twitter or on Facebook.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/08/28/president-trump-poised-to-award-first-medal-of-honor-to-black-veteran-of-recent-wars-alwyn-cashe/", "published": "2020-08-28T00:00:00"}, {"title": "NBA to Convert All Arenas into 2020 Voting Locations", "text": "LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla.

Hill praised this response to the Blake shooting and finally warmed to her central point.\n\n\u201cThis was a historic act. Black athletes\u2014and some allies of other races\u2014sent the message that America doesn\u2019t get to enjoy their talents if it can\u2019t respect Black people as human beings,\u201d she said shrilly.\n\nHill added that many players are realizing that all their activism for Black Lives Matter, their slogans on jerseys, and their donated money isn\u2019t fostering any \u201cchange\u201d they claim to seek. She claims that the feeling inside the NBA \u201cbubble\u201d in Florida where all the players are holed up to play the COVID quarantined season is one of \u201cmental exhaustion.\u201d Hill insisted that \u201csomething broke inside these players\u201d after the Blake shooting.\n\nSo, the boycott was their solution, and Hill says it was \u201cright\u201d and every other black athlete should join the NBA:\n\nDespite the potential financial risks, the players were right to explore whether they could grab America\u2019s attention by withholding their services. Had the NBA players opted to carry out a long-term strike, just imagine what that might have looked like: They play in cities that depend on the revenue they generate. Perhaps upon feeling the financial strain, officials in those cities might have been more motivated to reimagine their police force. Perhaps NBA owners might have been so bothered by losing money that they would have used their power and connections to put pressure on the right people to change the status quo. An extended strike also would have put pressure on NFL players to act. Pro football is by far the most popular sport in America. Nearly 70 percent of its players are Black. If Black NFL players followed the NBA players\u2019 lead, a big chunk of the sports economy would be made contingent on racial progress.\n\nHill concluded on a note of celebration:\n\n\u201cAt the very least, this week\u2019s historic disruption shows that Black players should leverage their talent to promote change at every possible opportunity. They\u2019ve tried to sweet-talk America into caring about racial injustice, but the litany continues,\u201d she crooned.\n\n\u201cWhen a country doesn\u2019t respect Black lives, it can\u2019t expect Black athletes to hold back their anger,\u201d she finished exultantly.\n\nOnly one thing that Hill didn\u2019t bother to address. And that is, just what \u201cchange\u201d have any of these multi-millionaire players affected? Sure, they have called every white person a racist, called the country evil, claimed everyone hates them \u2014 even though everyone has given them billions to play sports. But, what actual good has all this arm-waving and hate-spewing actually achieved?\n\nMaybe most people don\u2019t have much interest in each little thought coursing through every last random athlete\u2019s mind, and they are only interested in the game to which those athletes have dedicated their lives?\n\nMaybe the athletes\u2019 real frustration is their late realization that few people care what they have to say about deep subjects? Worse, perhaps people resent being called irredeemably racist by millionaire players and Atlantic writers?\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/sports/2020/08/28/jemele-hill-why-should-a-country-that-doesnt-value-black-lives-get-to-be-entertained-by-black-athletes/", "published": "2020-08-28T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Jemele Hill: \u2018Why Should a Country That Doesn\u2019t Value Black Lives Get to Be Entertained by Black Athletes?\u2019", "text": "On Thursday, Atlantic writer and former ESPN host Jemele Hill insisted that black athletes should stop \u201centertaining\u201d America because the country does not \u201cvalue black lives.\u201d\n\nHill pushed the calumny in her August 27 column where she praised the decision of the NBA to cancel this week\u2019s games in response to the police-involved shooting of Wisconsin man Jacob Blake.\n\nWhy should a country that doesn\u2019t value black lives get to be entertained by black athletes?

She claims that the feeling inside the NBA \u201cbubble\u201d in Florida where all the players are holed up to play the COVID quarantined season is one of \u201cmental exhaustion.\u201d Hill insisted that \u201csomething broke inside these players\u201d after the Blake shooting.\n\nSo, the boycott was their solution, and Hill says it was \u201cright\u201d and every other black athlete should join the NBA:\n\nDespite the potential financial risks, the players were right to explore whether they could grab America\u2019s attention by withholding their services. Had the NBA players opted to carry out a long-term strike, just imagine what that might have looked like: They play in cities that depend on the revenue they generate. Perhaps upon feeling the financial strain, officials in those cities might have been more motivated to reimagine their police force. Perhaps NBA owners might have been so bothered by losing money that they would have used their power and connections to put pressure on the right people to change the status quo. An extended strike also would have put pressure on NFL players to act. Pro football is by far the most popular sport in America. Nearly 70 percent of its players are Black. If Black NFL players followed the NBA players\u2019 lead, a big chunk of the sports economy would be made contingent on racial progress.\n\nHill concluded on a note of celebration:\n\n\u201cAt the very least, this week\u2019s historic disruption shows that Black players should leverage their talent to promote change at every possible opportunity. They\u2019ve tried to sweet-talk America into caring about racial injustice, but the litany continues,\u201d she crooned.\n\n\u201cWhen a country doesn\u2019t respect Black lives, it can\u2019t expect Black athletes to hold back their anger,\u201d she finished exultantly.\n\nOnly one thing that Hill didn\u2019t bother to address. And that is, just what \u201cchange\u201d have any of these multi-millionaire players affected? Sure, they have called every white person a racist, called the country evil, claimed everyone hates them \u2014 even though everyone has given them billions to play sports. But, what actual good has all this arm-waving and hate-spewing actually achieved?\n\nMaybe most people don\u2019t have much interest in each little thought coursing through every last random athlete\u2019s mind, and they are only interested in the game to which those athletes have dedicated their lives?\n\nMaybe the athletes\u2019 real frustration is their late realization that few people care what they have to say about deep subjects? Worse, perhaps people resent being called irredeemably racist by millionaire players and Atlantic writers?\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/sports/2020/08/28/jemele-hill-why-should-a-country-that-doesnt-value-black-lives-get-to-be-entertained-by-black-athletes/#disqus_thread", "published": "2020-08-28T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Report: Several \u2018Prominent\u2019 Black NFL Players Considering Sitting Out a Game in Protest", "text": "According to reports, several prominent black players are considering sitting out an NFL\u2019s game in an effort to \u201cforce change.\u201d\n\nJim Trotter of NFL Media noted on Friday that \u201c[a] few prominent Black players are telling me they want to sit out a game to make their feelings felt & force change/action.\u201d\n\nNFL owners should be careful.

And as I said in my speech last night, my dear friend, I made a promise to the women who I left behind and also the men that I would never stop fighting for them whenever and wherever it takes me.\n\nRUHLE: But it\u2019s more than saying you\u2019re fighting for criminal justice reform. By endorsing President Trump, you\u2019re saying he is the person who is fighting for criminal justice reform. You don\u2019t believe Joe Biden would?\n\nJOHNSON: I don\u2019t know what Joe Biden would do. I just know that with this administration they\u2019ve been open to the things I\u2019ve been bringing to the table. So I\u2019m so focused on my mission that I\u2019m not going to speak on what Joe Biden will or will not do. I\u2019m going to speak to what I know.\n\nRUHLE: Your speech seemed to make the most compelling case that President Trump say compassionate person. Do you believe other people in the African-American community believe that he\u2019s compassionate, especially given his law and order policies?\n\nJOHNSON: Well, even law and order must be underpinned by justice and mercy. You know, and many people who I\u2019ve talked to, they are very, very compelled by what he did for me and the compassion that he showed for me. I wouldn\u2019t dare speak to what other people think. I just know what I feel, and that I know he had compassion upon me and I know my situation moved him to act. When I speak, Stephanie, I speak from a personal place. I can\u2019t speak to anyone else.\n\nRUHLE: The president highlighted last night his executive order demanding ten-year prison sentences for anyone convicted of tearing down statues and monuments, including confederate statues. How does that square with his criminal justice reform? Ten years.\n\nJOHNSON: I mean, that was the first time that I heard that. And I don\u2019t know what his full policy is. I\u2019m not just trying to be careful, but I don\u2019t want to speak out of turn. And so that\u2019s why I can\u2019t say that because that was my first time hearing that.\n\nRUHLE: I can say that I certainly appreciate that you are no longer in prison and you\u2019re with your family. Last night you were sitting in the audience on the white house lawn for President Trump\u2019s speech. Most of the people around you were not wearing masks. Can i ask you, were you tested for coronavirus beforehand?\n\nJOHNSON: Yes, I\u2019ve been tested. I was tested before I went in there. So I had a mask on and the people around me who I was sitting with, they had been tested.\n\nRUHLE: Good. You know I want you to be safe, Alice.\n\nJOHNSON: Oh, yes, I know. I had my mask. As soon as I got up, I put that mask back on.\n\nRUHLE: Good. When I watched last night, I thought my girl Alice better have a mask. I want her safe.\n\nJOHNSON: Oh, I did. I had one right there.\n\nRUHLE: You had a chance, I\u2019m glad, to deliver your message to an enormous audience, to the country. What do you hope viewers took away from your speech?\n\nJOHNSON: I hope that they took away that there are many others like me who deserve a second chance and also my message to them that there is redemption. That there\u2019s so many others who deserve a second chance and not to just look at us as being disposable because they don\u2019t see us. so every time people see my face, I hope that they\u2019re reminded of the faces of others.\n\nRUHLE: Alice, you had said you don\u2019t know what Joe Biden would do in terms of criminal justice reform. Has his campaign reached out to you? And if they, do would you be opening to talking to him?\n\nJOHNSON: His campaign has not reached out to me. I would like to know everyone\u2019s plan what they have. I\u2019ve been working with the White House on what their plans on, and I feel good about them. So no one has reached out to me from his organization, from his campaign.\n\nRUHLE: Well, I appreciate all that you do every day, Alice. it\u2019s always a pleasure to see you.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/08/28/msnbcs-ruhle-to-alice-johnson-would-you-be-open-to-talking-to-biden-about-criminal-justice-reform/", "published": "2020-08-28T00:00:00"}, {"title": "MSNBC\u2019s Ruhle to Alice Johnson: Would You Be Open to Talking to Biden About Criminal Justice Reform?", "text": "Anchor Stephanie Ruhle asked criminal justice reform activist Alice Johnson, who spoke at the Republican National Convention in support of President Donald Trump, if she would be willing to talk to Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden about criminal justice reform, Friday on MSNBC.\n\nJohnson was granted clemency by President Trump after celebrity Kim Kardashian advocated for Johnson\u2019s release from a life sentence on a drug conspiracy and money laundering conviction.\n\nPartial transcript as follows:\n\nRUHLE: Joining me, my dear friend Alice Johnson.

Vernon Jones, a Democrat, as he left the White House to walk to his hotel after President Donald Trump\u2019s acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention (RNC) Thursday night.\n\nThe group of protesters shouted obscenities at Jones and the woman accompanying him. Some recognized him from his speech at the RNC and demanded that he say the name of Breonna Taylor, who was killed by police in Louisville.\n\n\u201cAre you a black Trump supporter?\u201d one asked. \u201cYou\u2019re a fucking disgrace! Shame!\u201d another shouted at Jones.\n\nPolice carrying bicycles formed a protective circle around Jones and his companion, moving them slowly down the street.\n\nThe crowd continued to harass Jones, shouting \u201cWhose streets? Our streets!\u201d and taunting police: \u201cWho [sic] do you protect?\u201d\n\nA voice shouted: \u201cYou house [n-word]!\u201d\n\nIn his address on Monday evening to the RNC, Jones said: \u201cThe Democratic Darty has become infected with a pandemic of intolerance, bigotry, socialism, anti-law enforcement bias, and a dangerous tolerance for people who attack others, destroy their property and terrorize our own communities.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what this election is all about. That\u2019s why right now, more than ever, more than ever before, America needs Donald Trump in the oval office for another four years.\u201d\n\nSeveral minutes later, a mob of protesters also trapped Sen.

Chris Coons (D-DE), a supporter of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, about how the Biden\u2019s campaign has handled the civil unrest in cities throughout America.\n\nCoons insisted Biden had been an opponent of rioting and looting. However, MacCallum pointed out that it did not get a mention during the Democratic debate.\n\nPartial transcript as follows:\n\nMACCALLUM: So let\u2019s bring in Democrat Senator Chris Coons, also advocate for Joe Biden. Senator, always good to have you with us. Thanks for being here tonight.\n\nSEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): Thanks, Martha. Great to be with you this evening.\n\nMACCALLUM: So I hope you heard the introduction. There was a woman who called into CSPAN, which was a Democrat voter from Minneapolis. She said that she was very upset. She almost sounded like she had tears in her voice when she spoke, that the Democrats at the convention did not talk about what\u2019s happening in her city.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve seen a pretty major pivot over the past 24 hours to Joe Biden starting to bring it up and others starting to bring it up as well so what\u2019s going on here?\n\nCOONS: Well, Martha, here\u2019s what I heard in the last few minutes in Mark Meadows interview and earlier today from Joe Biden. The Chief of Staff to President Trump just said something that is flat out demonstrably untrue, and Joe Biden spoke to it earlier today.\n\nFormer Vice President Biden is clear both that he finds these incidents, like the attack on Jacob Blake, like the brutal murder of George Floyd absolutely unacceptable. He thinks these are horrible. They should not happen in the United States, and he\u2019s denounced them and has called for a full and thorough and prompt investigation.\n\nAnd he joins the family of Jacob Blake in rejecting violence in saying that protesters who are peaceful and orderly, that\u2019s terrific. That is an appropriate way in the United States to express your concerns, but when it becomes a riot, when there\u2019s violence, when there\u2019s looting, that violates our laws, and Joe Biden, and Kamala Harris do not support that.\n\nMACCALLUM: Well, to be honest with you Senator, that\u2019s exactly \u2013\n\nCOONS: Well, we just heard Mark Meadows say that \u2013\n\nMACCALLUM: Say that what?\n\nCOONS: We just heard Mark Meadows say a completely untrue thing about Joe Biden\u2019s record and where he currently stands so I appreciate the chance to be on here and to help correct that record.\n\nMACCALLUM: Yes but everything that you just said about the concerns over the shooting of Jacob Blake and the killing of George Floyd, every American shares that feeling and every American, I think \u2013\n\nCOONS: Well, I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re going to hear that from President Trump tonight, are we, Martha? Martha, are we going to hear from President Trump tonight that he has a plan, both for how we\u2019re going to heal the racial divides in our country and for how we\u2019re going to recover from this pandemic.\n\nI\u2019ll remind you the United States has 5 million infected Americans. They have \u2013\n\nMACCALLUM: We\u2019ll come to COVID, but I want to understand this topic for just a moment if I may Senator, that the fact of the matter is I covered almost every minute of the Democratic Convention. There was no discussion about the violence is happening in our cities, and that\u2019s what you heard from that Democrat voter.\n\nShe said I\u2019ve changed my mind. I can\u2019t believe that no one is talking about what\u2019s happening. The looting, the rioting. Every time I brought up the question about what\u2019s happening in the cities, I was told it\u2019s not a big deal. And you know, that it\u2019s mostly peaceful protests.\n\nWe don\u2019t have mostly peaceful protests with huge fires burning in the back of them, and now suddenly there\u2019s a recognition on the part of Joe Biden, and I think that\u2019s great. I think everybody says yes, it is time to recognize the pain of these people who have their buildings and their businesses destroyed, Sir.\n\nCOONS: Martha, it\u2019s not sudden. This is something that Joe Biden has a long record on \u2014 supporting appropriate community policing. We\u2019re being presented with a false choice here. In the United States, we should expect justice for all Americans. We should expect to live in a country where we both uphold the rule of law, where we support law enforcement, where we expect folks to conduct themselves in peaceful and lawful ways.\n\nAnd where it\u2019s unacceptable, it\u2019s not necessary to our safety and security that police occasionally conduct themselves in unlawful ways so it\u2019s the family of Jacob Blake that is joining former Vice President Biden in calling for calm and peace in Kenosha.\n\nMACCALLUM: Absolutely, we heard that from Mrs. Jackson.\n\nCOONS: It is important that the American people know that Joe Biden has a long and clear and positive record of both fighting for racial injustice.\n\nMACCALLUM: So if you \u2013 honestly, if you can find me an instance where he condemned the violence and the looting and the rioting during the Democratic Convention, I would love for you to send it to me because if it exists, I will be the first one to admit that he spoke about it at that convention, but I did not see or hear him say that, but please let me know if you did.\n\nCOONS: Martha, please play his statement from today.\n\nMACCALLUM: No, that\u2019s different. I told you, I earlier, I said that the tone is changed in the last 24 hours. I absolutely heard what he said today, so I\u2019m glad I think most people are glad that there\u2019s a recognition. I know that woman voter for Minneapolis is glad that now that\u2019s being recognized on both sides of the aisle as well.\n\nI want to ask about the debates. What do you think Nancy Pelosi was suggesting today when she said that she thought that there shouldn\u2019t be any debates and that if she were advising Joe Biden, she would tell him not to debate President Trump. Are you OK with that?\n\nCOONS: Well, here\u2019s what I know is true. Joe Biden has accepted the three debates. Donald Trump has not. Joe Biden is eager to debate Donald Trump about his record, and I hope that tonight the American people instead of just a long string of attacks on Joe Biden, some of them untrue, we\u2019ll hear a positive plan from President Trump about how he\u2019s going to deal with both the pandemic and racial inequality.\n\nNancy Pelosi is the Speaker of the House. She\u2019s negotiating with Mark Meadows. I appreciate her advice, but former Vice President Joe Biden has already committed to three debates with Donald Trump. Donald Trump, our president, has not.\n\nMACCALLUM: Well, the last I heard he was pushing for a fourth debate and I think the consortium is also interested in that and they\u2019re waiting to hear a response from the Biden campaign because in 22 days people start voting and I think both sides feel that it would be helpful if the people who start voting in 22 days have already seen at least one of these debates.\n\nSo do you believe there should be a debate prior to the beginning of voting, so a fourth debate?\n\nCOONS: There absolutely should be debates between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. The argument in the Supreme Court of the United States in which President Trump, his allies and supporters in a dozen states are going to try to repeal, what is left of the Affordable Care Act of protection for 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions, that argument happens the week after the election.\n\nPresident Trump has talked out of both sides of his mouth about healthcare. He promised in 2016 that he would replace the Affordable Care Act with something that costs less and protect more. Instead, we\u2019ve got a system where he is still trying to take away healthcare for more than 100 million Americans.\n\nI think he should present in dignity his defense for that course of action.\n\nMACCALLUM: Absolutely, and I would love to ask him that question in a debate as well. I think it\u2019s a great question and both sides should be asked about what they\u2019re going to do about healthcare and everything else. Senator Coons, thank you very much.

He joined the administration of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi as chief cabinet secretary in 2005.\n\nAbe became the 21st president of the LDP, and the 90th prime minister of Japan, in September 2006 and resigned exactly one year later, after his party suffered huge losses in legislative elections and Abe suffered increasing complications from inflammatory bowel disease, an ailment he said he has struggled with since high school.\n\nAbe has said that only the advent of new medicines in 2009 allowed him to restore his health and return to politics. He became prime minister again in 2012 at the head of a resurgent LDP and has held the office ever since. The LDP changed its rules in 2017 to let him serve a third term as its president, and therefore remain prime minister, and it was ready to change them again so he could serve a fourth term, but Abe ruled that out in March 2019 and said he would leave office in 2021.\n\nAbe\u2019s return to the top office was followed by the launch of \u201cAbenomics,\u201d his ambitious program to increase Japan\u2019s gross domestic product while restraining inflation. Abe described his program as \u201cthree arrows\u201d in a quiver: fiscal stimulus, monetary policy, and structural reforms, including corporate tax cuts, regulatory relief, and a much-touted plan to bring more Japanese women into the workforce.\n\nThe reform arrow was arguably the one that hit its target closest to the bullseye. The rest of the Abenomics platform produced mixed results until recently, when it seemed the Japanese economy was finally starting to take off and then the coronavirus struck.\n\nLike most non-dictatorial world leaders, Abe got mixed reviews for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, including some jeers for encouraging tourism in a time of disease panic and distributing inadequate protective face masks that were nicknamed \u201cAbenomasks.\u201d His approval ratings currently stand at their lowest point during his eight-year term, largely due to the coronavirus and a faltering economy.\n\nIn the foreign policy arena, Abe was most renowned, and sometimes most reviled, for his hawkish stance on national defense and his desire to amend the pacifist constitution. Abe argued that Japan should be able to act in \u201ccollective defense\u201d with Japan\u2019s allies to neutralize threats beyond the country\u2019s borders, including terrorists, the psychotic dictatorship in North Korea, and perhaps an increasingly aggressive China.\n\nPacifism has become very deeply ingrained in Japanese society since World War II, so the changes Abe wished to make were highly controversial. There were fistfights over pacifism in parliament. Prime Minister Abe never got the changes he wanted.\n\nAbe found himself embroiled in a bitter dispute with South Korea over the lingering issues of conscripted labor and South Korean \u201ccomfort women\u201d abused by Imperial Japan during its occupation, and he was unable to settle Japan\u2019s other unfinished World War II business with Russia, which revolves around an intractable territorial dispute.\n\nOn the domestic front, Abe struggled with corruption and influence scandals, particularly a controversial land deal involving his wife that prompted his old mentor, former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, to call for Abe\u2019s resignation in April. Just when Abe thought he might have put the long-simmering controversy behind him, a former government official brought it back into the headlines by committing suicide. Even the company that gave Abe his big break in business, Kobe Steel, ended up in a controversy during his term, raising criticism that the LDP and Abenomics have been too indulgent to large, well-connected firms.\n\nAbe was credited with raising Japan\u2019s profile on the world stage, developing strong trading relationships with other Pacific Rim nations, significantly upgrading Japan\u2019s defenses even though he never got the constitutional amendments he wanted, and improving Japan\u2019s relationship with China.\n\nHe became one of the closest world leaders to U.S. President Donald Trump, nominating Trump for a Nobel Peace Prize in 2019. It can be difficult to judge such things among the pressure and illusions of global statecraft, but Trump and Abe seem to genuinely enjoy each other\u2019s company. Under the previous U.S. administration, Abe was credited with arranging President Barack Obama\u2019s visit to Hiroshima, the first time a sitting U.S. president paid a visit to the city destroyed by a nuclear bomb in World War II.\n\nAbe is generally lauded for bringing stability to Japan, both in domestic politics and international relations. His long tenure as prime minister came after a string of predecessors who rarely lasted more than a year. He was able to bring the economy out of a recession, even if the subsequent performance of Abenomics was often disappointing, and Abe may yet have the last word on economic reform, since the coronavirus is prodding many other nations to adopt platforms similar to his. With the obvious exception of South Korea, he generally did a good job of strengthening Japan\u2019s crucial alliances and trade partnerships.\n\nHis departure may bring a period of unwelcome political instability as successors jockey for position. Abe declined to endorse anyone to replace him, although the inside word is that he favors his party policy chief, Fumio Kishida.\n\nThe LDP looks to remain dominant against a divided opposition. The top advisers and close allies who would normally be logical choices to take up his mantle, like Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga and Deputy Prime Minister/Finance Minister Taro Aso, have suffered from declining approval ratings as Abe himself became unpopular. Kishida might prove to be a tough sell to Japanese voters because he is associated with the lackluster coronavirus response. Waiting in the wings is former LDP chief Shigeru Ishiba, an old adversary of Abe\u2019s who has been building support from both the public and LDP lawmakers.

Trump vows to end sanctuary cities and win the race to 5G. He promises a more ambitious space program (He says America will land the first woman on the moon and will be the first nation to plant its flag on Mars.) in addition to missile defense.

Americans are exhausted trying to keep up with the latest list of approved words and phrases, and the ever-more restrictive political decrees. Many things have a different name now, and the rules are constantly changing. The goal of cancel culture is to make decent Americans live in fear of being fired, expelled, shamed, humiliated, and driven from society as we know it.

Trump says at least 13 members of the Biden campaign donated to bail out the rioters and looters.\n\nTrump now tells the story of the late David Dorn, whose wife powerfully spoke earlier.\n\n\u201cWe are honored to be joined tonight by his wife Ann and beloved family members: Brian and Kielen.

Three years ago, she was ambushed and murdered \u201cby a monster who hated her purely for wearing the badge.\u201d\n\n\u201cDetective Familia was a single mom. She\u2019d recently asked for the night shift so she could spend more time with her kids.

He promised to end national security travel bans from Jihadist nations, and he pledged to increase refugee admissions by 700 percent. This is in the manifesto. The Biden Plan would eliminate America\u2019s borders in the middle of a global pandemic.\u201d He says Biden is even talking about \u201ctaking the wall down. How about that?\u201d\n\nTrump says \u201cBiden claims he has empathy for the vulnerable, yet the party he leads supports the extreme late-term abortion of defenseless babies right up to the moment of birth. Democrat leaders talk about moral decency, but they have no problem with stopping a baby\u2019s beating heart in the ninth month of pregnancy.\u201d He says Democrats \u201d refuse to protect innocent life, and then they lecture us about morality and saving America\u2019s soul\u2026.Tonight, we proudly declare that all children, born and unborn, have a God-given right to life.\u201d\n\nTrump says during the DNC, \u201cunder God\u201d was removed from the Pledge of Allegiance twice.\n\n11:05 PM: Trump says he will impose tariffs on any company that leaves America to produce jobs overseas. He says Biden\u2019s agenda is \u201cMade in China\u201d while his agenda is \u201cMade in the USA.\u201d\n\n\u201cBiden has promised to abolish the production of American oil, coal, shale, and natural gas \u2013 laying waste to the economies of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Colorado, and New Mexico,\u201d Trump then says while talking about energy issues, blaming these policies for crippling power outages in California.

His shutdown would inflict unthinkable and lasting harm on our nation\u2019s children, families, and citizens of all backgrounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe cost of the Biden shutdown would be measured in increased drug overdoses, depression, alcohol addiction, suicides, heart attacks, economic devastation, job loss and much more. Joe Biden\u2019s plan is not a solution to the virus, but rather it\u2019s a surrender to the virus\u201d he says.\n\nTrump vows to \u201ccrush\u201d the virus before saying while Biden claims to be an \u201cally of the light,\u201d but when it comes to his agenda, he wants to keep us completely in the dark. He says Biden\u2019s tax hikes will collapse the economy and the stock market.\n\n10:50 PM: Trump says the Middle East was in chaos when he took office. He said he withdrew from the Iran Deal and, unlike previous presidents, kept his promise to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. After talking about the first Middle East peace deal in 25 years and obliterating ISIS and killing al-Baghdadi and Iran\u2019s Soleimani, Trump says unlike past administrations, he kept America out of wars (and rebuilding the military) and spent the last four years reversing the damage Biden did over the last 47 years. He says Biden supported NAFTA, supported China\u2019s entry into the WTO, which led to America losing one-in-four manufacturing jobs. He says voters in the Rust Belt didn\u2019t want to hear Biden\u2019s hollow words of \u201cempathy. They wanted their jobs back.\u201d He says Biden opposed killing bin Laden and cheered China\u2019s rise. He says \u201cChina would own our country\u201d if Biden is elected. He says based on good information, China wants Biden to win.\n\n10:49 PM: Trump says he has done more for the Black community than Joe Biden has done in 47 years and the best is yet to come.\n\n10:45 PM: Trump talks about ending catch and release and deporting 20,000 gang members and 50,000 criminal aliens. He salutes Border Patrol officers in attendance. He talks about taking on Big Pharma and passing Right to Try in addition to VA accountability and VA choice. He talks about opportunity zones, criminal justice reform, and funding for HBCUs.\n\n10:42 PM: Trump says Washington insiders have pleaded with him to let China steal our jobs and robbing us blind but, \u201cWe took the toughest, boldest, strongest, and hardest hitting action against China in American History.\u201d\n\nTrump said the establishment said it would be impossible to replace NAFTA, but they were wrong when he signed the USMCA trade deal into law.\n\n10:40 PM: Trump says he has done nothing but fight for you since he left his former life.\n\nThe moment President Trump walked out on stage in the South Lawn of the White House. pic.twitter.com/IHHuiQXfnp \u2014 Yamiche Alcindor (@Yamiche) August 28, 2020\n\n\u201cI did what our political establishment never expected and could never forgive, breaking the cardinal rule of Washington Politics. I kept my promises,\u201d Trump says. Together, we have ended the rule of the failed political class \u2013 and they are desperate to get their power back by any means necessary. You\u2019ve seen that. They are angry at me because instead of putting them first, I\u2019ve simply put America first.\u201d\n\n10:38 PM: Trump says Biden took the donations of blue-collar workers for 47 years and gave them hugs and kisses, told them he felt their pain, and then flew back to Washington and shipped their jobs to China and to distant lands and outsourced their dreams, offshoring their jobs, opening borders, and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars that never ended.\n\nHe says he ran for president because he could not watch this betrayal of our country and watch other countries take advantage of us on trade, borders, foreign policy, and national defense.\n\n10:35 PM: Trump says this election is about the American dream versus socialism. He says it\u2019s about protecting law-abiding citizens vs. giving free reign to agitators and criminals who threaten our citizens. He says it\u2019s about defending the American way of life or allowing radicals to destroy it.\n\nHe says at the DNC, Biden assailed America as a land of racial, social, and economic injustice. He says how can Democrats ask to lead our country when they spend so much time tearing down our country.\n\nHe says the left sees America as a nation that must be \u201cpunished\u201d for its wickedness. They say redemption can only be given by giving power to them. He says in America, we don\u2019t turn to government to restore our souls. We put our faith in Almighty God.\n\n10:30 PM: Trump \u201cprofoundly\u201d accepts the nomination for president of the United States with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism.\n\nBREAKING: President Trump accepts the GOP nomination for president during final night of #RNC2020: \u201cMy fellow Americans, tonight with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism, I profoundly accept this nomination for president of the United States.\u201d https://t.co/EyJzJDolZ4 pic.twitter.com/vrB4nAsNW5 \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) August 28, 2020\n\nHe says the Republican Party goes forward to welcome Democrats, independents, and anyone else who believes in the righteous hearts of the American people.

She assures everyone she is not a ghost and she is free.\n\n\u201cSome say, \u2018You do the crime. You do the time.\u2019 However, that time should be fair and just. We\u2019ve all made mistakes, and none of us want to be defined forever based on our worst decision,\u201d she says. \u201cWhile in prison, I became a playwright, a mentor, a certified hospice volunteer, an ordained minister, and received the Special Olympics Event Coordinator of the year award for my work with disabled women.

Carl says al-Baghdadi raped his daughter repeatedly while beating and torturing her.\n\n\u201cWe put all our faith in the government. But our government let us down. President Obama refused to meet with us until ISIS had already beheaded other Americans. To this day, we\u2019ve never heard from Joe Biden. Instead, the Obama administration hid behind policy so much that we felt hopeless when they kept us from negotiating to save Kayla\u2019s life,\u201d Carl Mueller says. \u201cThe administration showed more concern for the terrorists in Guantanamo than for the American hostages in Syria.\u201d\n\nHe says the \u201cmilitary prepared a rescue mission, but the White House delayed it. By the time it went forward, Kayla had been moved to a different location.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a difference a president makes,\u201d he continues.\n\n\u201cThe Trump team gave us empathy we never received from the Obama administration. The Obama administration said it was doing everything it could. The Trump administration is,\u201d he says. \u201cLet me just say this: Kayla should be here. If Donald Trump had been President when Kayla was captured, she would be here today.\u201d\n\n9:46 PM. Sen. Cotton says Obama\u2019s secretary of defense said Biden has gotten almost every foreign policy decision wrong and compares Biden\u2019s foreign policy record to Trump\u2019s:\n\nJoe Biden slashed defense spending again and again. President Trump rebuilt our military\u2014and added the Space Force.\n\nJoe Biden let ISIS terrorists rampage across the Middle East. President Trump eliminated ISIS\u2019s leader\u2014and destroyed its caliphate.\n\nJoe Biden opposed the mission to kill Osama bin Laden. President Trump avenged the murder of hundreds of Americans by killing Iran\u2019s terrorist mastermind, Qassim Soleimani.\n\nJoe Biden sent pallets of cash to the ayatollahs. President Trump ripped up the dangerous Iran nuclear deal.\n\nJoe Biden treated Israel like a nuisance. President Trump moved our embassy to Jerusalem and brokered peace deals in the Middle East.\n\nJoe Biden coddled socialist dictators in Cuba and Venezuela. President Trump fights against communism\u2014in America\u2019s backyard and around the world.\n\nAnd on the Communist Party of China, there is no comparison.\n\nJoe Biden aided and abetted China\u2019s rise for fifty years with terrible trade deals that closed our factories and laid off our workers. President Trump stands up to China\u2019s cheating, and stealing, and lying.\n\nJoe Biden allowed Chinese fentanyl to flood across our southern border. President Trump sanctioned Chinese drug dealers for poisoning our kids.\n\nAfter saying China is rooting for Biden, Cotton says we need a president who stands up for America, not someone like Biden who will take a knee.\n\nSen.

Too many of our fellow Americans are already honored at the hallowed grounds of Arlington,\u201d Cotton continues. \u201cBut if we want peace, we must be strong. Weakness is provocative. President Trump\u2019s strength has kept us out of war. Joe Biden won\u2019t stand up for America. Donald Trump will. So this November, let\u2019s stand with the president and vote to keep America great.\u201d\n\n9:36 PM: Giuliani says don\u2019t let Democrats do to America what they have done to New York. He says New Yorkers are wondering \u201chow did we get overwhelmed by crime so quickly and decline so fast.\u201d He says this \u201cunprecedented wave of lawlessness began with a truly just cause\u2013 the unforgiveable police killing of George Floyd.\u201d\n\nHe accuses BLM and Antifa of hijacking peaceful protest into vicious and brutal riots because a \u201cunified proposal to reduce police misconduct\u201d would make Trump seem like a leader.\n\nGiuliani talks about the murder of 4-year old LeGen Taliferro in Kansas City, 17-year-old New York basketball Star Brandon Hendricks, who had committed to St. John\u2019s, one-year-old Davell Gardner, Jr., who was shot and killed in a stroller at a cook-out in Brooklyn. He said these murders caused no outrage on the left.\n\n\u201cFor President Trump, and for us Republicans, all Black Lives Matter and the lives of LaGen, Brandon and Davell matter to us,\u201d he says.\n\nHe cites the murders in Chicago and presumes Black lives in Chicago did not matter to Obama-Biden. He says the crime wave will continue if Biden is elected and says this is something that cannot be solved from Biden\u2019s basement.\n\n\u201cThere is no question that this awesome job of restoring safety cannot be done from your basement, Joe,\u201d he says.\n\n9:33 PM: Police Benevolent Association President Pat Lynch of New York says the stakes have never been higher.\n\n\u201cLike cops across this country, we are staring down the barrel of a public safety disaster,\u201d he says.\n\nHe says people in the community ask him every day why so many people are getting murdered. He says \u201cthe answer is simple: The Democrats have walked away from us. Democratic politicians have surrendered our streets and institutions.\u201d\n\nHe says Democrats have passed laws that have made it impossible for police officers to work without their hands tied behind their backs.\n\nThere is nobody who hates bad cops more than good cops, but that doesn\u2019t matter to the radical left. To them, we\u2019re all bad, because we\u2019re all blue. Their anti-law enforcement campaign isn\u2019t about a single incident. It\u2019s about a message. The message is: police officers are the enemy.\n\nThe message is: criminals have the right to resist arrest. The message is: if you victimize a vulnerable person, the justice system will not hold you accountable,\u201d he says. \u201cThe criminals have heard that message, and they are taking full advantage. We must stop that message. We must expose the left\u2019s lies about police officers and the job we do.\u201d\n\nHe says while Democrats are running in fear of the mob in the streets, Trump has never apologized \u201cfor standing up for law and order.\u201d\n\n9:25 PM: Dr. Ben Carson says his heart goes out to the Blake family.\n\nBen Carson: \"Our hearts go out to the Blake family, and the other families who've been impacted by the tragic events in Kenosha.\" Full #RNC2020 video here: https://t.co/ZpNptJvTzQ pic.twitter.com/woWRKI7PlC \u2014 CSPAN (@cspan) August 28, 2020\n\n\u201cIn order to succeed in change, we must first come together in love of our fellow citizens,\u201d Carson says.\n\nHe says Trump believes in the people and is \u201cone of us.\u201d\n\nHe does not submit to political correctness or to its enforcers, the media. He is real.\n\n\u201cRight now, we need real. We need courage. We can\u2019t cower in the corner and hope that no one calls us a name, believing that will keep us safe. That is not courage, and that will not lead us to a good and just place,\u201d Carson says. \u201cWe must remember all those who sacrificed everything in order to give us freedom, and we must be willing to do the same for those who come after us.\u201d\n\nHe says Trump also doesn\u2019t dabble in identity politics and wants everyone to succeed.\n\n\u201cMany on the other side love to incite division by claiming that President Trump is a racist. They could not be more wrong,\u201d Carson says. \u201cYears ago, Jesse Jackson gave Donald Trump an award for the economic opportunities he created for Black people. In Palm Beach, Florida, Donald Trump led the crusade to allow blacks and Jews into private clubs and resorts. One of the first things he did as president was bring the Office of Historically Black Colleges and Universities into the White House so that it could get proper attention and financial support. Before the pandemic, African American unemployment was at an all-time low.\u201d\n\nCarson also touts Trump\u2019s prison reform agenda and support for school choice.\n\nCarson says what \u201cis racist is the fact that African Americans have the highest abortion rate,\u201d and he hails Trump as the most pro-life president.\n\n9;19 PM: Ann Dorn\u2014the widow of the late David Dorn, a retired police officer whom a looter murdered during the George Floyd protests in St Louis\u2013says her husband \u201chad a big smile and a heart to match. He was blessed with the gift of gab, and that gift enabled him to touch souls and inspire people, especially young people.\u201d\n\nHe says after David retired, he still befriended everyone. She talks about a young man named Lee who opened a pawn shop. Whenever the shop\u2019s alarm went off, the alarm company called Dave\u2026She says most of the alarms were false alarms:\n\nThe alarm that went off the morning of June 2nd was for real. It was a violent night in St. Louis. Four police officers were shot. Others were hit with rocks and fireworks. At least 55 businesses were damaged, looted, or set on fire. As the Officer Wellness and CIT Coordinator with the police department, I was keenly aware of the rioting and spent the evening getting ready to mobilize support for officers who were impacted. After I had gone to bed, Dave received a call from Lee\u2019s alarm company. The front door of the pawn shop had been breached. This time, he didn\u2019t wake me up to tell me. He probably knew I would have tried to stop him or insisted on going with him. As I slept, looters were ransacking the shop. They shot and killed Dave in cold blood and then live-streamed the execution and his last moments on this earth. Dave\u2019s grandson was watching the video on Facebook in real time, not realizing he was watching his own grandfather dying on the sidewalk.\n\nShe says she re-lives this horror in her mind every day.\n\n\u201cMy hope is that having you re-live it with me now will help shake this country from this nightmare we\u2019re witnessing in our cities and bring about positive, peaceful change,\u201d she says. \u201cHow did we get to this point where so many young people are so callous and indifferent towards human life? This isn\u2019t a video game where you can commit mayhem and then hit reset and bring all the characters back to life. David is never coming back to me. He was murdered by people who didn\u2019t know, and just didn\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nAnn Dorn says \u201cviolence and destruction are not legitimate forms of protest. They do not safeguard black lives.\u201d She says Trump knows we need more Davids in our communities\u2013not fewer.\n\n9:15 PM: Debbie Flood, who owns a small foundry and machine shop in Wisconsin that manufactures cast bronze architectural hardware, says she lost nearly 50% of her business to China in the mid-2000s. She wondered how a small company like hers could continue to compete.\n\n\u201cAt the time, Joe Biden was a senator,\u201d she says. \u201cHe voted to normalize trade with China and helped pave the way for them to join the WTO, even though they were hurting American companies like ours.\u201d\n\nShe says that when \u201cDonald Trump was elected, and we breathed a sigh of relief.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe actually fought for American workers and American craftsmen,\u201d she says. \u201cHe actually cared about bringing back those three beautiful words, \u2018Made in America.'\u201d\n\nShe says Biden doesn\u2019t know anything about creating jobs or business. She says he has spent 47 years in government and it is doubtful he will figure it out in year 48.\n\n9:10 PM: Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes talks about his Hawaiian, Filipino, Japanese and Spanish ancestry.\n\n\u201cMy father demonstrated his warrior spirit over 50 years ago fighting a dictator in his homeland\u2013the Philippines. Barely escaping with his life, he started anew in America,\u201d he says. \u201cHe arrived with nothing but faith, determination and a willingness to work hard. He lived the American Dream, building businesses, a family and seeing me become Utah\u2019s first minority statewide elected official. Today, I channel my warrior roots by battling human trafficking.\u201d\n\nHe says he has led some of the largest human trafficking prosecutions and \u201cPresident Donald Trump is a fierce warrior against human trafficking.\u201d He says Trump asked insightful questions and \u201cpromised to attack this evil\u201d when they met in 2017.\n\nReyes says he lost his father to cancer a few months ago: \u201cWhen he passed, he had by his bedside: his scriptures, family photos and a pen President Trump gave me to give him. Dad loved that pen. It represented freedom to him, the freedom that only exists when someone is willing to fight for it\u201d\n\n\u201cTo my father, President Trump is that ultimate warrior fighting for our freedom,\u201d he continues. \u201cIf you listen to Democrats, the media, and liberal elite, they will tell you that America\u2019s light doesn\u2019t shine as brightly around the world as it once did. That\u2019s simply not true. The same light that brought my father to America inspires the desperate and downtrodden equally today.\u201d\n\n9:05 PM: UFC\u2019s Dana White touts Trump\u2019s economic accomplishments and rails against people who want to defund the police. He praises Trump for working to bring back the economy safely after COVID hit.\n\nMMA promoter Dana White talking about \"lawless destruction.\" \"C'mon America!

He says Democrats want to defund the police and take away your Second Amendment rights. They want to give free health care to illegal immigrants and offer no protections to the unborn. He says with two more liberal Senators, we can\u2019t undo the damage they will do. He says that is why Democrats spent two weeks not saying anything about what Joe Biden will do before saying the GOP Senate is the \u201cfirewall\u201d against Nancy Pelosi\u2019s agenda.\n\n8:54 PM: Dan Scavino, who has been working for Trump for 30 years, says he never would have imagined he would be working for Trump for three decades.\n\n\u201cAll these years later, there is a part of me that still feels a sense of wonder every day when I consider the journey we have taken together \u2014 and taken with so many of you watching tonight,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause my personal story with Donald Trump, in so many ways, is your story, too. He saw potential in me. A spark. The possibility that I could be more, do more, and achieve more than even I thought was possible. That\u2019s how he views this country, too. We have all just scratched the surface of what we can do together.\u201d\n\nHe says if there is one thing viewers take away from him tonight, \u201cit is this\u2013President Trump is a kind and decent man. I wish you could be at his side with me to see his endless kindness to everyone he meets.\u201d\n\nBiden Campaign commercial airs while Fox cuts coverage from Scavino\u2019s speech pic.twitter.com/8hbN8ieltk \u2014 Acyn Torabi (@Acyn) August 28, 2020\n\nHe says Trump can\u2019t be bought, bullied, or beaten.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is the first leader who\u2019s been too strong, too tough, and too savvy to be crushed by the status quo establishment and the political media class,\u201d he says before saying what they call \u201cchaos,\u201d Trump calls \u201cchange.\u201d\n\nHe says Trump is a man of the people and points out the RNC featured real Americans \u201cwho are just like us.\u201d\n\n8:51 PM: Stacia Brightmon talks about having been homeless and finding out about from the Texas Workforce Commission about S&B\u2019s Women in Construction Earn-While-You-Learn apprenticeship program. She says President Trump backed \u201cpolicies that made it easy for states and companies to give opportunities to hardworking Americans\u201d like her.\n\nC-SPAN\n\n8:45 PM: Rep. Jeff Van Drew says how he became a Republican says a lot about today\u2019s Democrats. He says Democrats had become less accepting of American traditions and exceptionalism. He says it was not the party he knew and says his first vote in the House was against the San Francisco liberal for House Speaker. He says, with the Squad, Democrats went from being liberal to radical and were no longer about just raising taxes. They were also for open borders. He says he voted no on impeachment and met with Trump soon after and the president made him feel more comfortable than Pelosi made him feel in her caucus. He says he then became a Republican a few days later. He says when Democrats tried to order him around, he said he had had enough with their radical, socialist agenda. He says Biden \u201cis being told what to do by the radicals running my former party.\u201d\n\nJeff Van Drew said during Impeachment proceedings Democrats told him to fall in line or lose reelection. \u201cListen, I\u2019m from South Jersey and you better come at me with more than loud words and empty threats.

He said he didn\u2019t know a Republican growing up and believed all the stereotypes. He says Trump cares about every issue important to Black communities and talks about Trump\u2019s funding for HBCUs and fight for school choice. He says he has shown the \u201cdeep empathy\u201d Trump has shown the families who have been killed by senseless violence after mentioning the deaths of George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery. He says Trump has a lot of Cleveland in him for a New Yorker.\n\nWhite House advisor Ja'Ron Smith: \"Growing up, I'd never really known a Republican. I believed all the stereotypes.

We are not a nation of timid spirits. We are a nation of fierce, proud, and independent American patriots.\u201d\n\nTrump wants every child in America to know that they are part of the most exciting adventure in human history.\n\n\u201cNo matter where your family comes from, no matter your background, in America, anyone can rise. With hard work, devotion, and drive, you can reach any goal and achieve every ambition,\u201d he says.\n\n11:25 PM: Trump vows to make America the manufacturing superpower of the world and end our reliance on China while not getting into endless wars. Trump vows to end sanctuary cities and win the race to 5G. He promises a more ambitious space program (He says America will land the first woman on the moon and will be the first nation to plant its flag on Mars.) in addition to missile defense. He also says if he doesn\u2019t win, \u201cyour Second Amendment doesn\u2019t have a chance.\u201d\n\nTrump also promises to \u201crestore patriotic education to our schools\u201d and always \u201cprotect free speech on college campuses.\u201d\n\nTrump says this is the unifying national agenda that will bring the country together.\n\n11:22 PM: Trump says Biden is a \u201cweak\u201d candidate who \u201ctakes his marching orders from liberal hypocrites who drive their cities into the ground while fleeing far from the scene of the wreckage.\u201d He says they want to prevent school choice while sending their kids to the best schools; want to open borders while living in gated communities; want to defund the police while having armed security details.\n\n11:20 PM: Trump says we must also \u201creclaim our independence from the left\u2019s repressive mandates. Americans are exhausted trying to keep up with the latest list of approved words and phrases, and the ever-more restrictive political decrees. Many things have a different name now, and the rules are constantly changing. The goal of cancel culture is to make decent Americans live in fear of being fired, expelled, shamed, humiliated, and driven from society as we know it. The far-left wants to coerce you into saying what you know to be false, and scare you out of saying what you know to be true.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump: \u201cAmericans are exhausted trying to keep up with the latest lists of approved words \u2026 the goal of cancel culture is to make decent Americans live in fear of being fired, expelled, shamed, humiliated and driven from society.\u201d https://t.co/EyJzJDolZ4 #RNC2020 pic.twitter.com/h68yEthsCA \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) August 28, 2020\n\n11:18 PM: Trump says if Democrats want to \u201cto stand with anarchists, agitators, rioters, looters, and flag-burners, that is up to them.\u201d But the Republican Party will remain the voice of the patriotic heroes who keep America safe and salute the American flag.\u201d\n\nTrump says Biden and Democrats ignore the thousands of African-Americans killed in cities run by Democrats, but he never will.\n\nTrump says they are coming after him because he is fighting for you.\n\n11:16 PM: Trump rips Biden for not mentioning the riots at the convention and says Democrats are now talking about it because their poll numbers are sinking like a rock in water. Trump says at least 13 members of the Biden campaign donated to bail out the rioters and looters.\n\nTrump now tells the story of the late David Dorn, whose wife powerfully spoke earlier.\n\n\u201cWe are honored to be joined tonight by his wife Ann and beloved family members: Brian and Kielen. To each of you: we will never forget the heroic legacy of Captain David Dorn,\u201d Trump says. \u201cGreat man.\u201d\n\n11:15 PM: Trump says we can\u2019t allow mob rule, and the GOP condemns the rioting in cities run by Democrats like Portland, Kenosha, Chicago, and New York.\n\n15th and Pennsylvania. Protesters are waving noisemakers and shooting fireworks right outside the White House gate in an effort to drown out President Trump\u2019s speech. (@wusa9) pic.twitter.com/q5zXRu3rfr \u2014 John Henry (@JohnHenryWUSA) August 28, 2020\n\nTrump says when he signed an order for 10-year prison sentences for those tearing down monuments, they suddenly stopped.\n\n11:10 PM: Trump warns if you give power to Biden, the radical left will defund police departments all over America. They will make every city look like Portland and \u201cnobody will be safe in Biden\u2019s America.\u201d He says his administration will always stand with America\u2019s law enforcement officers. Trump introduces the story of Detective Miosotis Familia of the NYPD. Three years ago, she was ambushed and murdered \u201cby a monster who hated her purely for wearing the badge.\u201d\n\n\u201cDetective Familia was a single mom. She\u2019d recently asked for the night shift so she could spend more time with her kids. Two years ago, I stood in front of the U.S. Capitol alongside those children, and held their grandmother\u2019s hand as they mourned their terrible loss and we honored Detective Familia\u2019s extraordinary life.\u201d Trump introduces her three children Genesis, Peter, and Delilah.\n\nTrump says we must remember that the overwhelming majority of police officers are good and noble but they are afraid to do their jobs right now and thus are unable to protect the people they want to serve.\n\n11:06 PM: After ripping Biden for wanting to give lawyers and health care to illegal immigrants, Trump says Biden also \u201csupports deadly sanctuary cities that protect criminal aliens. He promised to end national security travel bans from Jihadist nations, and he pledged to increase refugee admissions by 700 percent. This is in the manifesto. The Biden Plan would eliminate America\u2019s borders in the middle of a global pandemic.\u201d He says Biden is even talking about \u201ctaking the wall down. How about that?\u201d\n\nTrump says \u201cBiden claims he has empathy for the vulnerable, yet the party he leads supports the extreme late-term abortion of defenseless babies right up to the moment of birth. Democrat leaders talk about moral decency, but they have no problem with stopping a baby\u2019s beating heart in the ninth month of pregnancy.\u201d He says Democrats \u201d refuse to protect innocent life, and then they lecture us about morality and saving America\u2019s soul\u2026.Tonight, we proudly declare that all children, born and unborn, have a God-given right to life.\u201d\n\nTrump says during the DNC, \u201cunder God\u201d was removed from the Pledge of Allegiance twice.\n\n11:05 PM: Trump says he will impose tariffs on any company that leaves America to produce jobs overseas. He says Biden\u2019s agenda is \u201cMade in China\u201d while his agenda is \u201cMade in the USA.\u201d\n\n\u201cBiden has promised to abolish the production of American oil, coal, shale, and natural gas \u2013 laying waste to the economies of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Colorado, and New Mexico,\u201d Trump then says while talking about energy issues, blaming these policies for crippling power outages in California. He says how can Biden claim to be an ally of the light when his own party can\u2019t even keep the lights on.\n\nPresident Trump: \"How can the Democrat Party ask to lead our country when it spends so much time tearing down our country?\" #RNC2020 pic.twitter.com/2g0FG03e91 \u2014 The Hill (@thehill) August 28, 2020\n\n11:02 PM: Trump says that \u201cinstead of following the science, Joe Biden wants to inflict a painful shutdown on the entire country. His shutdown would inflict unthinkable and lasting harm on our nation\u2019s children, families, and citizens of all backgrounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe cost of the Biden shutdown would be measured in increased drug overdoses, depression, alcohol addiction, suicides, heart attacks, economic devastation, job loss and much more. Joe Biden\u2019s plan is not a solution to the virus, but rather it\u2019s a surrender to the virus\u201d he says.\n\nTrump vows to \u201ccrush\u201d the virus before saying while Biden claims to be an \u201cally of the light,\u201d but when it comes to his agenda, he wants to keep us completely in the dark. He says Biden\u2019s tax hikes will collapse the economy and the stock market.\n\n10:50 PM: Trump says the Middle East was in chaos when he took office. He said he withdrew from the Iran Deal and, unlike previous presidents, kept his promise to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. After talking about the first Middle East peace deal in 25 years and obliterating ISIS and killing al-Baghdadi and Iran\u2019s Soleimani, Trump says unlike past administrations, he kept America out of wars (and rebuilding the military) and spent the last four years reversing the damage Biden did over the last 47 years. He says Biden supported NAFTA, supported China\u2019s entry into the WTO, which led to America losing one-in-four manufacturing jobs. He says voters in the Rust Belt didn\u2019t want to hear Biden\u2019s hollow words of \u201cempathy. They wanted their jobs back.\u201d He says Biden opposed killing bin Laden and cheered China\u2019s rise. He says \u201cChina would own our country\u201d if Biden is elected. He says based on good information, China wants Biden to win.\n\n10:49 PM: Trump says he has done more for the Black community than Joe Biden has done in 47 years and the best is yet to come.\n\n10:45 PM: Trump talks about ending catch and release and deporting 20,000 gang members and 50,000 criminal aliens. He salutes Border Patrol officers in attendance. He talks about taking on Big Pharma and passing Right to Try in addition to VA accountability and VA choice. He talks about opportunity zones, criminal justice reform, and funding for HBCUs.\n\n10:42 PM: Trump says Washington insiders have pleaded with him to let China steal our jobs and robbing us blind but, \u201cWe took the toughest, boldest, strongest, and hardest hitting action against China in American History.\u201d\n\nTrump said the establishment said it would be impossible to replace NAFTA, but they were wrong when he signed the USMCA trade deal into law.\n\n10:40 PM: Trump says he has done nothing but fight for you since he left his former life.\n\nThe moment President Trump walked out on stage in the South Lawn of the White House. pic.twitter.com/IHHuiQXfnp \u2014 Yamiche Alcindor (@Yamiche) August 28, 2020\n\n\u201cI did what our political establishment never expected and could never forgive, breaking the cardinal rule of Washington Politics. I kept my promises,\u201d Trump says. Together, we have ended the rule of the failed political class \u2013 and they are desperate to get their power back by any means necessary. You\u2019ve seen that. They are angry at me because instead of putting them first, I\u2019ve simply put America first.\u201d\n\n10:38 PM: Trump says Biden took the donations of blue-collar workers for 47 years and gave them hugs and kisses, told them he felt their pain, and then flew back to Washington and shipped their jobs to China and to distant lands and outsourced their dreams, offshoring their jobs, opening borders, and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars that never ended.\n\nHe says he ran for president because he could not watch this betrayal of our country and watch other countries take advantage of us on trade, borders, foreign policy, and national defense.\n\n10:35 PM: Trump says this election is about the American dream versus socialism. He says it\u2019s about protecting law-abiding citizens vs. giving free reign to agitators and criminals who threaten our citizens. He says it\u2019s about defending the American way of life or allowing radicals to destroy it.\n\nHe says at the DNC, Biden assailed America as a land of racial, social, and economic injustice. He says how can Democrats ask to lead our country when they spend so much time tearing down our country.\n\nHe says the left sees America as a nation that must be \u201cpunished\u201d for its wickedness. They say redemption can only be given by giving power to them. He says in America, we don\u2019t turn to government to restore our souls. We put our faith in Almighty God.\n\n10:30 PM: Trump \u201cprofoundly\u201d accepts the nomination for president of the United States with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism.\n\nBREAKING: President Trump accepts the GOP nomination for president during final night of #RNC2020: \u201cMy fellow Americans, tonight with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism, I profoundly accept this nomination for president of the United States.\u201d https://t.co/EyJzJDolZ4 pic.twitter.com/vrB4nAsNW5 \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) August 28, 2020\n\nHe says the Republican Party goes forward to welcome Democrats, independents, and anyone else who believes in the righteous hearts of the American people. He says we will rebuild the greatest economy in American history in the next term while defending American against all threats and protecting American against all dangers. Trump talks about reaching new heights of national achievement and a \u201cnew spirit of unity that can only be realized through love of our great country.\u201d\n\nTrump says America is not a land cloaked in darkness but a torch that lights the world.\n\nTrump speaks about the \u201cinvisible enemy\u201d and says there will be a vaccine before the end of the year and maybe even sooner. He says we will defeat the virus, end the pandemic, and emerge stronger than ever before.\n\n10:25 PM: Trump now up to speak as the audience chants \u201cUSA!\u201d and \u201cfour more years!\u201d\n\nThe Trumps walk in to Lee Greenwood\u2019s \u201cProud to be an American,\u201d a patriotic hit on country music stations since the first Gulf war. #RNC2020 pic.twitter.com/xRdwyezocx \u2014 Bloomberg QuickTake (@QuickTake) August 28, 2020\n\nTrump says he is brimming with confidence in the bright future we will build over the next four years. He sends our thoughts are with the wonderful people who have come through the wrath of Hurricane Laura.

She talks about blue-collar workers telling him he is their only hope. She says they are the reason he ran for the White House and why he will fight for four more years.\n\nIvanka isn\u2019t exempt from the Hatch act so this speech is illegal \u2014 Zerlina Maxwell (@ZerlinaMaxwell) August 28, 2020\n\nIvanka really thinks she's VP lol \u2014 Meena Harris (@meenaharris) August 28, 2020\n\nIvanka says her dad rectified the wrongs of Biden\u2019s Crime Bill that disproportionately impacted African-Americans.

She assures everyone she is not a ghost and she is free.\n\n\u201cSome say, \u2018You do the crime. You do the time.\u2019 However, that time should be fair and just. We\u2019ve all made mistakes, and none of us want to be defined forever based on our worst decision,\u201d she says. \u201cWhile in prison, I became a playwright, a mentor, a certified hospice volunteer, an ordained minister, and received the Special Olympics Event Coordinator of the year award for my work with disabled women. Because the only thing worse than unjustly imprisoning my body, is trying to imprison my mind.\u201d\n\nShe says her transformation was described as extraordinary and her Christian faith and the prayers of so many kept hope alive.\n\nShe says Trump had compassion and acted when he heard her story.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it. I always remembered that God knew my name, even in my darkest hour. But I never thought a president would,\u201d Johnson says.\n\nShe says she is using her voice to tell the stories of others like others and praises Trump for signing the First Step Act into law six months after she was freed.\n\n9:48 PM: Carl and Marsha Mueller, the parents of the late Kayla Mueller, are speaking. Carl says al-Baghdadi raped his daughter repeatedly while beating and torturing her.\n\n\u201cWe put all our faith in the government. But our government let us down. President Obama refused to meet with us until ISIS had already beheaded other Americans. To this day, we\u2019ve never heard from Joe Biden. Instead, the Obama administration hid behind policy so much that we felt hopeless when they kept us from negotiating to save Kayla\u2019s life,\u201d Carl Mueller says. \u201cThe administration showed more concern for the terrorists in Guantanamo than for the American hostages in Syria.\u201d\n\nHe says the \u201cmilitary prepared a rescue mission, but the White House delayed it. By the time it went forward, Kayla had been moved to a different location.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a difference a president makes,\u201d he continues.\n\n\u201cThe Trump team gave us empathy we never received from the Obama administration. The Obama administration said it was doing everything it could. The Trump administration is,\u201d he says. \u201cLet me just say this: Kayla should be here. If Donald Trump had been President when Kayla was captured, she would be here today.\u201d\n\n9:46 PM. Sen. Cotton says Obama\u2019s secretary of defense said Biden has gotten almost every foreign policy decision wrong and compares Biden\u2019s foreign policy record to Trump\u2019s:\n\nJoe Biden slashed defense spending again and again. President Trump rebuilt our military\u2014and added the Space Force.\n\nJoe Biden let ISIS terrorists rampage across the Middle East. President Trump eliminated ISIS\u2019s leader\u2014and destroyed its caliphate.\n\nJoe Biden opposed the mission to kill Osama bin Laden. President Trump avenged the murder of hundreds of Americans by killing Iran\u2019s terrorist mastermind, Qassim Soleimani.\n\nJoe Biden sent pallets of cash to the ayatollahs. President Trump ripped up the dangerous Iran nuclear deal.\n\nJoe Biden treated Israel like a nuisance. President Trump moved our embassy to Jerusalem and brokered peace deals in the Middle East.\n\nJoe Biden coddled socialist dictators in Cuba and Venezuela. President Trump fights against communism\u2014in America\u2019s backyard and around the world.\n\nAnd on the Communist Party of China, there is no comparison.\n\nJoe Biden aided and abetted China\u2019s rise for fifty years with terrible trade deals that closed our factories and laid off our workers. President Trump stands up to China\u2019s cheating, and stealing, and lying.\n\nJoe Biden allowed Chinese fentanyl to flood across our southern border. President Trump sanctioned Chinese drug dealers for poisoning our kids.\n\nAfter saying China is rooting for Biden, Cotton says we need a president who stands up for America, not someone like Biden who will take a knee.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton: \u201cWe need a president who stands up for America \u2014 not one to takes a knee. A strong and proud America is a safe America.\u201d https://t.co/SssWAdjj98 #RNC2020 pic.twitter.com/PAZ3AmRdFD \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) August 28, 2020\n\n\u201cNo one who\u2019s seen the face of war desires to see it again. Too many of our fellow Americans are already honored at the hallowed grounds of Arlington,\u201d Cotton continues. \u201cBut if we want peace, we must be strong. Weakness is provocative. President Trump\u2019s strength has kept us out of war. Joe Biden won\u2019t stand up for America. Donald Trump will. So this November, let\u2019s stand with the president and vote to keep America great.\u201d\n\n9:36 PM: Giuliani says don\u2019t let Democrats do to America what they have done to New York. He says New Yorkers are wondering \u201chow did we get overwhelmed by crime so quickly and decline so fast.\u201d He says this \u201cunprecedented wave of lawlessness began with a truly just cause\u2013 the unforgiveable police killing of George Floyd.\u201d\n\nHe accuses BLM and Antifa of hijacking peaceful protest into vicious and brutal riots because a \u201cunified proposal to reduce police misconduct\u201d would make Trump seem like a leader.\n\nGiuliani talks about the murder of 4-year old LeGen Taliferro in Kansas City, 17-year-old New York basketball Star Brandon Hendricks, who had committed to St. John\u2019s, one-year-old Davell Gardner, Jr., who was shot and killed in a stroller at a cook-out in Brooklyn. He said these murders caused no outrage on the left.\n\n\u201cFor President Trump, and for us Republicans, all Black Lives Matter and the lives of LaGen, Brandon and Davell matter to us,\u201d he says.\n\nHe cites the murders in Chicago and presumes Black lives in Chicago did not matter to Obama-Biden. He says the crime wave will continue if Biden is elected and says this is something that cannot be solved from Biden\u2019s basement.\n\n\u201cThere is no question that this awesome job of restoring safety cannot be done from your basement, Joe,\u201d he says.\n\n9:33 PM: Police Benevolent Association President Pat Lynch of New York says the stakes have never been higher.\n\n\u201cLike cops across this country, we are staring down the barrel of a public safety disaster,\u201d he says.\n\nHe says people in the community ask him every day why so many people are getting murdered. He says \u201cthe answer is simple: The Democrats have walked away from us. Democratic politicians have surrendered our streets and institutions.\u201d\n\nHe says Democrats have passed laws that have made it impossible for police officers to work without their hands tied behind their backs.\n\nThere is nobody who hates bad cops more than good cops, but that doesn\u2019t matter to the radical left. To them, we\u2019re all bad, because we\u2019re all blue. Their anti-law enforcement campaign isn\u2019t about a single incident. It\u2019s about a message. The message is: police officers are the enemy.\n\nThe message is: criminals have the right to resist arrest. The message is: if you victimize a vulnerable person, the justice system will not hold you accountable,\u201d he says. \u201cThe criminals have heard that message, and they are taking full advantage. We must stop that message. We must expose the left\u2019s lies about police officers and the job we do.\u201d\n\nHe says while Democrats are running in fear of the mob in the streets, Trump has never apologized \u201cfor standing up for law and order.\u201d\n\n9:25 PM: Dr. Ben Carson says his heart goes out to the Blake family.\n\nBen Carson: \"Our hearts go out to the Blake family, and the other families who've been impacted by the tragic events in Kenosha.\" Full #RNC2020 video here: https://t.co/ZpNptJvTzQ pic.twitter.com/woWRKI7PlC \u2014 CSPAN (@cspan) August 28, 2020\n\n\u201cIn order to succeed in change, we must first come together in love of our fellow citizens,\u201d Carson says.\n\nHe says Trump believes in the people and is \u201cone of us.\u201d\n\nHe does not submit to political correctness or to its enforcers, the media. He is real.\n\n\u201cRight now, we need real. We need courage. We can\u2019t cower in the corner and hope that no one calls us a name, believing that will keep us safe. That is not courage, and that will not lead us to a good and just place,\u201d Carson says. \u201cWe must remember all those who sacrificed everything in order to give us freedom, and we must be willing to do the same for those who come after us.\u201d\n\nHe says Trump also doesn\u2019t dabble in identity politics and wants everyone to succeed.\n\n\u201cMany on the other side love to incite division by claiming that President Trump is a racist. They could not be more wrong,\u201d Carson says. \u201cYears ago, Jesse Jackson gave Donald Trump an award for the economic opportunities he created for Black people. In Palm Beach, Florida, Donald Trump led the crusade to allow blacks and Jews into private clubs and resorts. One of the first things he did as president was bring the Office of Historically Black Colleges and Universities into the White House so that it could get proper attention and financial support. Before the pandemic, African American unemployment was at an all-time low.\u201d\n\nCarson also touts Trump\u2019s prison reform agenda and support for school choice.\n\nCarson says what \u201cis racist is the fact that African Americans have the highest abortion rate,\u201d and he hails Trump as the most pro-life president.\n\n9;19 PM: Ann Dorn\u2014the widow of the late David Dorn, a retired police officer whom a looter murdered during the George Floyd protests in St Louis\u2013says her husband \u201chad a big smile and a heart to match. He was blessed with the gift of gab, and that gift enabled him to touch souls and inspire people, especially young people.\u201d\n\nHe says after David retired, he still befriended everyone. She talks about a young man named Lee who opened a pawn shop. Whenever the shop\u2019s alarm went off, the alarm company called Dave\u2026She says most of the alarms were false alarms:\n\nThe alarm that went off the morning of June 2nd was for real. It was a violent night in St. Louis. Four police officers were shot. Others were hit with rocks and fireworks. At least 55 businesses were damaged, looted, or set on fire. As the Officer Wellness and CIT Coordinator with the police department, I was keenly aware of the rioting and spent the evening getting ready to mobilize support for officers who were impacted. After I had gone to bed, Dave received a call from Lee\u2019s alarm company. The front door of the pawn shop had been breached. This time, he didn\u2019t wake me up to tell me. He probably knew I would have tried to stop him or insisted on going with him. As I slept, looters were ransacking the shop. They shot and killed Dave in cold blood and then live-streamed the execution and his last moments on this earth. Dave\u2019s grandson was watching the video on Facebook in real time, not realizing he was watching his own grandfather dying on the sidewalk.\n\nShe says she re-lives this horror in her mind every day.\n\n\u201cMy hope is that having you re-live it with me now will help shake this country from this nightmare we\u2019re witnessing in our cities and bring about positive, peaceful change,\u201d she says. \u201cHow did we get to this point where so many young people are so callous and indifferent towards human life?

She wondered how a small company like hers could continue to compete.\n\n\u201cAt the time, Joe Biden was a senator,\u201d she says. \u201cHe voted to normalize trade with China and helped pave the way for them to join the WTO, even though they were hurting American companies like ours.\u201d\n\nShe says that when \u201cDonald Trump was elected, and we breathed a sigh of relief.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe actually fought for American workers and American craftsmen,\u201d she says. \u201cHe actually cared about bringing back those three beautiful words, \u2018Made in America.'\u201d\n\nShe says Biden doesn\u2019t know anything about creating jobs or business.

Barely escaping with his life, he started anew in America,\u201d he says. \u201cHe arrived with nothing but faith, determination and a willingness to work hard. He lived the American Dream, building businesses, a family and seeing me become Utah\u2019s first minority statewide elected official. Today, I channel my warrior roots by battling human trafficking.\u201d\n\nHe says he has led some of the largest human trafficking prosecutions and \u201cPresident Donald Trump is a fierce warrior against human trafficking.\u201d He says Trump asked insightful questions and \u201cpromised to attack this evil\u201d when they met in 2017.\n\nReyes says he lost his father to cancer a few months ago: \u201cWhen he passed, he had by his bedside: his scriptures, family photos and a pen President Trump gave me to give him. Dad loved that pen. It represented freedom to him, the freedom that only exists when someone is willing to fight for it\u201d\n\n\u201cTo my father, President Trump is that ultimate warrior fighting for our freedom,\u201d he continues. \u201cIf you listen to Democrats, the media, and liberal elite, they will tell you that America\u2019s light doesn\u2019t shine as brightly around the world as it once did. That\u2019s simply not true. The same light that brought my father to America inspires the desperate and downtrodden equally today.\u201d\n\n9:05 PM: UFC\u2019s Dana White touts Trump\u2019s economic accomplishments and rails against people who want to defund the police.

He says Democrats want to defund the police and take away your Second Amendment rights. They want to give free health care to illegal immigrants and offer no protections to the unborn. He says with two more liberal Senators, we can\u2019t undo the damage they will do. He says that is why Democrats spent two weeks not saying anything about what Joe Biden will do before saying the GOP Senate is the \u201cfirewall\u201d against Nancy Pelosi\u2019s agenda.\n\n8:54 PM: Dan Scavino, who has been working for Trump for 30 years, says he never would have imagined he would be working for Trump for three decades.\n\n\u201cAll these years later, there is a part of me that still feels a sense of wonder every day when I consider the journey we have taken together \u2014 and taken with so many of you watching tonight,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause my personal story with Donald Trump, in so many ways, is your story, too. He saw potential in me. A spark. The possibility that I could be more, do more, and achieve more than even I thought was possible. That\u2019s how he views this country, too. We have all just scratched the surface of what we can do together.\u201d\n\nHe says if there is one thing viewers take away from him tonight, \u201cit is this\u2013President Trump is a kind and decent man. I wish you could be at his side with me to see his endless kindness to everyone he meets.\u201d\n\nBiden Campaign commercial airs while Fox cuts coverage from Scavino\u2019s speech pic.twitter.com/8hbN8ieltk \u2014 Acyn Torabi (@Acyn) August 28, 2020\n\nHe says Trump can\u2019t be bought, bullied, or beaten.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is the first leader who\u2019s been too strong, too tough, and too savvy to be crushed by the status quo establishment and the political media class,\u201d he says before saying what they call \u201cchaos,\u201d Trump calls \u201cchange.\u201d\n\nHe says Trump is a man of the people and points out the RNC featured real Americans \u201cwho are just like us.\u201d\n\n8:51 PM: Stacia Brightmon talks about having been homeless and finding out about from the Texas Workforce Commission about S&B\u2019s Women in Construction Earn-While-You-Learn apprenticeship program. She says President Trump backed \u201cpolicies that made it easy for states and companies to give opportunities to hardworking Americans\u201d like her.\n\nC-SPAN\n\n8:45 PM: Rep. Jeff Van Drew says how he became a Republican says a lot about today\u2019s Democrats. He says Democrats had become less accepting of American traditions and exceptionalism. He says it was not the party he knew and says his first vote in the House was against the San Francisco liberal for House Speaker. He says, with the Squad, Democrats went from being liberal to radical and were no longer about just raising taxes. They were also for open borders. He says he voted no on impeachment and met with Trump soon after and the president made him feel more comfortable than Pelosi made him feel in her caucus. He says he then became a Republican a few days later. He says when Democrats tried to order him around, he said he had had enough with their radical, socialist agenda. He says Biden \u201cis being told what to do by the radicals running my former party.\u201d\n\nJeff Van Drew said during Impeachment proceedings Democrats told him to fall in line or lose reelection. \u201cListen, I\u2019m from South Jersey and you better come at me with more than loud words and empty threats.

He said he didn\u2019t know a Republican growing up and believed all the stereotypes. He says Trump cares about every issue important to Black communities and talks about Trump\u2019s funding for HBCUs and fight for school choice. He says he has shown the \u201cdeep empathy\u201d Trump has shown the families who have been killed by senseless violence after mentioning the deaths of George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery. He says Trump has a lot of Cleveland in him for a New Yorker.\n\nWhite House advisor Ja'Ron Smith: \"Growing up, I'd never really known a Republican. I believed all the stereotypes.

The pandemic has driven millions of hearts with fear. We are divided \u2026 Anger and despair have floated to the streets. We need your help. We need to hear your voice at this crucial hour. We ask that you unite our hearts, to be one nation under God, for you are our only hope.\u201d\n\nDuring his speech, Graham took a moment to \u201cthank\u201d God for President Trump, praying for his safety and guidance.\n\n\u201cWe declare today our total dependence on you and our repentance as people,\u201d Graham said. \u201cI thank you tonight for our president, Donald J. Trump. We pray that you will give him wisdom \u2026 clarity of vision and strength as he leads this nation forward. Bless him. We pray for our first lady Melania, their son Barron, and all of the family. Protect them and keep them strong and safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe thank you for our Vice President Mike Pence, for a steady hand and a clear voice, we pray for second lady Karen Pence and their family,\u201d Graham stated. \u201cFather, we know that you can make this nation great once again if we turn our eyes and our hearts to you and follow your word and obedience. May your will be done on this earth as it is in Heaven. And we pray this in the mighty name of your Son, my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

Upon being abducted and identified as a Westerner, ISIS jihadists placed Kayla into slavery. She became the property of Abu Sayyaf and wife Umm Sayyaf (\u201cUmm\u201d a common pseudonym for women jihadists meaning \u201cmother\u201d), where the \u201ccaliph\u201d of the terrorist group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, raped and tortured her.\n\nA U.S. military raid in October resulted in al-Baghdadi\u2019s death.

It was cold and dirty. ISIS terrorists shined bright lights in her face. They shaved her head. They beat her and tortured her,\u201d father Carl Mueller detailed. \u201cThe leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, raped her repeatedly. For 18 months, she endured.

The Obama administration said it was doing everything it could. The Trump administration actually is,\u201d Carl Mueller said.\n\n\u201cLet me just say this: Kayla should be here.

Upon being abducted and identified as a Westerner, ISIS jihadists placed Kayla into slavery. She became the property of Abu Sayyaf and wife Umm Sayyaf (\u201cUmm\u201d a common pseudonym for women jihadists meaning \u201cmother\u201d), where the \u201ccaliph\u201d of the terrorist group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, raped and tortured her.\n\nA U.S. military raid in October resulted in al-Baghdadi\u2019s death. Cornered by a military canine, al-Baghdadi detonated a suicide bomb, killing himself and three of his children.\n\n\u201cHe died like a dog, he died like a coward,\u201d President Donald Trump said at the time. \u201cThe world is now a much safer place.\u201d\n\nThe mission to capture al-Baghdadi was named after Kayla.\n\nKayla Mueller is believed to have died in Raqqa, Syria \u2013 the \u201ccapital\u201d of the Islamic State caliphate \u2013 in February 2015. ISIS terrorists claimed that a Jordanian airstrike targeting al-Baghdadi killed her, but have never presented any evidence corroborating that claim.\n\nThe Muellers recalled their daughter as \u201camazing,\u201d with \u201ca gift to be able to see the world through someone else\u2019s eyes.\u201d Marsha Mueller noted that Kayla\u2019s existence was a sort of miracle, as doctors had told the couple they likely could not have conceived her.\n\nThey noted that her gift of empathy took her to Syria, where she was abducted and, they said, largely ignored by the incumbent Obama administration.\n\n\u201cKayla was mostly held in a 12\u2019 by 12\u2019 cell in solitary confinement. It was cold and dirty. ISIS terrorists shined bright lights in her face. They shaved her head. They beat her and tortured her,\u201d father Carl Mueller detailed. \u201cThe leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, raped her repeatedly. For 18 months, she endured. And we endured an agonizing back-and-forth between us, the Obama administration, and ISIS.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe put all our faith in the government. But our government let us down,\u201d Carl Mueller lamented.\n\nCarl Mueller then accused the Obama White House of delaying a mission that could have rescued his daughter and placing very little importance on the case.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama refused to meet with us until ISIS had already beheaded other Americans. To this day, we\u2019ve never heard from Joe Biden,\u201d Carl Mueller said. \u201cInstead, the Obama administration hid behind policy so much that we felt hopeless when they kept us from negotiating to save Kayla\u2019s life.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe administration showed more concern for the terrorists in Guantanamo than for the American hostages in Syria,\u201d Carl noted pointedly. \u201cThe Obama administration kept telling us they were doing everything they could.

In the fishing industry, foreign workers were offered more than 30 percent less for their jobs than Americans in the field. In the meatpacking industry, foreign workers got 23 percent less pay than Americans.\n\nEvery year, the U.S. admits about 1.2 million legal immigrants on green cards to permanently resettle in the country. In addition, another 1.4 million foreign workers are admitted every year to take American jobs\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

He also repeated \u2014 word-for-word \u2014 his script for the debunked \u201cvery fine people\u201d hoax, and claimed \u2014 falsely \u2014 that Trump has never condemned David Duke.\n\nBiden said:\n\nHave you ever heard this president say one negative thing about white supremacists? Have you ever heard it? That\u2019s the reason I got back in this race because of what happened in Charlottesville. People coming out of the woods carrying torches, their veins bulging. Close your eyes and remember what you saw. And a young woman gets killed, that resisting the hate and violence. And the president gets asked to comment on it. what does he say? He says there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t even condemn David Duke, for God\u2019s sake.\n\nTrump has repeatedly condemned white supremacists. Here\u2019s \u201cone negative thing\u201d \u2014 from a televised White House address:\n\nNo matter the color of our skin, we all live under the same laws, we all salute the same great flag, and we are all made by the same almighty God. We must love each other, show affection for each other, and unite together in condemnation of hatred, bigotry, and violence. We must rediscover the bonds of love and loyalty that bring us together as Americans. Racism is evil. And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans. We are a nation founded on the truth that all of us are created equal. We are equal in the eyes of our Creator. We are equal under the law. And we are equal under our Constitution. Those who spread violence in the name of bigotry strike at the very core of America.\n\nThere are many other such examples. Biden\u2019s claim was a lie, and Anderson Cooper failed to confront him with the facts.\n\nNotably, Biden has an egregious records of racist statements, most recently claiming \u201cyou ain\u2019t black\u201d if you vote for Trump.\n\nJoel B.

Biden again claimed falsely that President Trump had referred to neo-Nazis and white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, as \u201cvery fine people.\u201d This is a lie that has been debunked repeatedly \u2014 and yet Biden persists with it, even though he has been challenged directly about the fact that he is misquoting Trump, who said the neo-Nazis and white supremacists should be \u201ccondemned totally.\u201d The \u201cvery fine people\u201d were non-violent protesters on either side of the issue of the removal of a statue of Confederate general Robert E.

First Lady Melania Trump shared the grief of those families who have lost loved ones to the disease, as did Vice President Mike Pence. Biden\u2019s statement is utterly indefensible and suggests he did not watch the RNC, but had it summarized for him.\n\nBiden claimed that Trump talked about \u201cinjecting bleach.\u201d Trump never said that. He talked about injecting ultraviolet (UV) light, a long-used disinfectant, into the lungs as an experimental therapy. When a journalist asked whether he meant to encourage injecting bleach, Trump specifically said no. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be through injection. We\u2019re talking about through almost a cleaning, sterilization of an area.\u201d Trump\u2019s remarks were widely misconstrued, and Biden continues to misquote him.\n\nBiden claimed that the Trump administration had no plan for distributing a vaccine for coronavirus. The plan is called Operation Warp Speed, and the president talks about it frequently. The goal of the plan is to distribute 300 million doses of vaccine to the entire country \u2014 something Biden specifically claimed Trump had no plan to do. The plans and documents are available on the website of the Department of Health and Human Services, and have been available there for months.\n\nBiden claimed that there were no race riots during the Obama-Biden administration and the National Guard was never called.

Her exact quote was: \u201cThe more chaos and anarchy and vandalism and violence reigns, the better it is for the very clear choice on who\u2019s best on public safety and law and order.\u201d Biden omitted the context, in which Conway had pointed out that Democrat mayors and governors had refused President Trump\u2019s offers to send help to stop the violence and the looting.\n\n\u201cJacob Blake was never mentioned in any of the speeches at the Republican convention.\u201d This last lie was told by Mitchell herself.

Kamala Harris (D-CA) argued on Thursday, regarding Jacob Blake\u2019s shooting by Wisconsin police, that black lives have never \u201cbeen treated as fully human\u201d in America.\n\nHarris, the Democrat vice-presidential nominee, made the remark in a speech that was billed as a pre-rebuttal to President Donald Trump\u2019s appearance at the Republican National Convention. The California lawmaker, in particular, argued recent events, including Blake\u2019s shooting and the death of George Floyd in police custody, had exposed the difficult realities facing many of the country\u2019s citizens.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that the life of a black person in America has never been treated as fully human,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe have yet to fulfill that promise of equal justice under the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder people are taking to the streets. And I support them,\u201d she added in another part of the speech. \u201cWe must always defend peaceful protests and peaceful protestors. We should not confuse them with those looting and committing acts of violence, including the shooter who was arrested for murder.\u201d\n\nHarris\u2019s speech came as protests and rioting have continued to roil portions of Wisconsin. The tumult began on Sunday in Kenosha, Wisconsin, when local police shot Blake, a 29-year-old black American man, several times in the back. According to local media reports, police were called to respond to a \u201cdomestic incident\u201d at the site of the shooting. Several witnesses have claimed that Blake was attempting to break up a fight between two women when police arrived.\n\nVideo from the scene, which went viral on social media, shows Blake walking away from police as the officers have their weapons drawn. In the video, Blake is seen opening the door of an SUV as a police officer attempts to stop him before firing at least seven shots into his back.\n\nAfter the video of the shooting appeared on social media, protests erupted on the streets of Kenosha. Those protests quickly turned violent. On Monday, in particular, several businesses were burnt to the ground, including, a local charity.\n\nThe situation only intensified on Tuesday with more looting and confrontations occurring across Kenosha. One of those incidents caught national attention when a 17-year-old Illinois resident, Kyle Rittenhouse, killed two individuals and wounded a third with a rifle. Rittenhouse, who had identified himself as a supporter of law enforcement, was arrested on Wednesday for the shootings.\n\nIn the wake of such incidents, the Department of Justice announced it is deploying federal resources to Wisconsin to help quell the unrest.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/08/27/kamala-harris-the-life-of-a-black-person-in-america-has-never-been-treated-as-fully-human/", "published": "2020-08-27T00:00:00"}, {"title": "***Live Updates*** Republican National Convention Night Three", "text": "The Republican National Convention continues on Wednesday, and Vice President Mike Pence is tonight\u2019s headliner.

Pence rips Biden for criticizing Trump for ridding the world of two terrorists. He says it\u2019s no surprise because Biden even opposed the mission to hunt down Osama bin Laden.

Rolling back red tape. Unleashing American energy and fighting for free and fair trade.\n\nPence says America became a net exporter of energy for the first time in 70 years while unemployment rates for African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans hit record lows.\n\nAnd then, he says, the Coronavirus struck from China. Pence says before the first case spread, Trump suspended travel from China and that saved American lives and \u201cbought us invaluable time\u201d to combat the Coronavirus.\n\nPence says nobody who needed a ventilator was denied one and talks up the administration\u2019s economic recovery plan.\n\nHe says Biden said that \u201cno miracle is coming,\u201d but Biden doesn\u2019t understand that \u201cAmerica is a nation of miracles.\u201d He says America is on track to have a Coronavirus vaccine by the end of this year.\n\nPence says we\u2019re not just opening up America again but we\u2019re also opening up America\u2019s schools.

He says the Trump administration has done both since day one.\n\nPence says Biden thinks America is systemically racist and law enforcement has an implicit bias against people of color, and he will double down on the policies that are causing violence all over America.\n\n\u201cThe hard truth is you won\u2019t be safe in Joe Biden\u2019s America,\u201d he says before saying the Trump administration will always stand with the thin blue line and will never defund the the police\u2013not now, not ever.\n\nVice President Pence: Under President Trump, we will stand with those who stand on the Thin Blue Line, and we\u2019re not going to defund the police\u2014not now, not ever.#RNC2020 pic.twitter.com/NU0Og0fvVA \u2014 Team Trump (Text VOTE to 88022) (@TeamTrump) August 27, 2020\n\nPence asks what Biden is a transition to\u2013he says Democrats didn\u2019t talk much about agenda and he doesn\u2019t blame them. Pence notes that Bernie Sanders said that many of the ideas he fought for are now mainstream. He says at the root of their agenda is that America is driven by envy and the federal government must be involved in every aspect of our lives to \u201ccorrect America\u2019s wrongs.\u201d\n\n\u201cTheir agenda is based on government control,\u201d Pence says. \u201cOurs is based on freedom.\u201d\n\nPence rips Biden for wanting to give free health care and lawyers to illegal immigrants.\n\nPence says Biden supports taxpayer-funded abortion right up to birth, and Biden will be a \u201cTrojan Horse\u201d for the radical left.\n\nPence says this election is not so much whether America will be more conservative or liberal. He says the choice is whether America remains America, whether we live to our children and grandchildren a country grounded in our highest ideals\u2026 or whether we will leave a country that has fundamentally transformed into something else. He says the election is between \u201cfreedom and opportunity\u201d and \u201csocialism and decline.\u201d\n\nPence closes by talking about the toughness that runs in our national character that invading forces learned on approach to this fort on September 1814. Against fierce and sustained bombardment, our young country was defended by heroes, not so different from those with us tonight. The enemy was counting on them to quit. But they never did. Fort McHenry held. And when morning came our flag was still here.\n\nMy fellow Americans, we are going through a time of testing. But if you look through the fog of these challenging times, you will see our flag is still there.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom these hallowed grounds, American patriots in generations gone by did their part to defend freedom. Now it\u2019s our turn.\n\nSo let\u2019s run the race marked out for us. Let\u2019s fix our eyes on Old Glory and all she represents, fix our eyes on this land of heroes and let their courage inspire, let\u2019s fix our eyes on the author and perfector of our faith and freedom, and never forget that \u2018where the spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.\u2019 That means freedom always wins,\u201d Pence says.\n\nTrump joins him on stage as the Trace Adkins performs the National Anthem.\n\nHe says he leaves inspired and more convinced that Americans will re-elect Trump so they can \u201cmake America great again, again.\u201d\n\n10:19 PM: Ric Grenell said during the presidential debates four years ago only one candidate (Trump) said what everyone was thinking inside re: American foreign policy.\n\n\u201cHe called America\u2019s endless wars what they were: A disaster,\u201d he says. \u201cThe media was shocked, because Donald Trump was running as a Republican. And yet he said out loud what we all knew. That American foreign policy was failing to make Americans safer.\u201d\n\nGrenell says that \u201cafter the end of the Cold War, Democrats and Republicans in Washington bought into the illusion that the whole world would start to resemble America. And so they started to pursue unlimited globalization.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey welcomed China into the World Trade Organization. They engaged in nation-building in Afghanistan, and tried to export democracy to Iraq. They signed a nuclear deal with Iran, and a global climate agreement in Paris,\u201d he says. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t ground any of it in the interests of the average American. So for decades, while Washington politicians built a global system, American wages stagnated. Our great cities and industries were hollowed out. Entire communities were devastated, and our manufacturing plants were shipped off to China. That\u2019s what happened when Washington stopped being the capital of the United States, and started being the capital of the world.\u201d\n\nHe says he saw Trump charm Merkel and tell other leaders he didn\u2019t fault them for outmaneuvering America\u2019s past leaders but it stops with him.\n\nHe says Trump has not started any new wars and even convinced Democrats of China\u2019s threat.\n\n\u201cThe Washington elites want you to think this kind of foreign policy is immoral. And so they call it nationalist,\u201d he says. \u201cThat tells you all you need to know. The DC crowd thinks when they call Donald Trump a nationalist, they\u2019re insulting him. As if the American president isn\u2019t supposed to base foreign policy on America\u2019s national interests.\u201d\n\nRichard Grenell: \"The D.C. crowd think when they call Donald Trump a nationalist, they're insulting him.

But that plane was on a different mission \u2013 an air strike to take out the head of Iran\u2019s terror machine who plotted the deaths of Americans.\u201d\n\nAfter ripping Obama-Biden for spying on Trump officials and the Russia collusion hoax, Grenell explains Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy: America First does not advance the interests of one group of Americans at the expense of any other. It has no bias about red or blue, educated or not educated, urban or rural. America First is simply the belief that politicians should focus on the equality and dignity of every American. nd that this duty is fulfilled by promoting the safety and wealth of the American people above all else. That\u2019s America First. That\u2019s the Trump Doctrine. And that, my friends, is four more years.\u201d\n\n10:15 PM: Clarence Henderson, who participated in the Woolworth sit-ins, says he was born on the wrong side of the tracks, doesn\u2019t have a birth certificate, never attended integrated schools, is a civil rights activists\u2026and is a Republican who supports Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cIf that sounds strange to you, learn your history,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was the Republican Party that passed the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery; it was the Republican Party that passed the 14th Amendment giving black men citizenship; and it was the Republican Party that passed the 15th Amendment giving Black men the right to vote.\u201d\n\nC-SPAN\n\nHe adds that \u201cthere are African-American voters all over the country who the media is trying to convince to conform to the same old Democratic talking points. You know what that\u2019ll get you? The same old results.\u201d\n\nHe jabs Biden: \u201cJoe Biden had the audacity to say if you don\u2019t vote for him \u2018you ain\u2019t black.'\u201d Well to that, I say, if you do vote for Biden, you ain\u2019t smart!\u201d\n\nHe says Trump\u2019s policies show his heart and show that he cares about Black lives. He says Trump has done more for Blacks in four years than Biden has done in 50.\n\n10:12 PM: Sam Vigil says there is a hole in his heart since his wife Jackie, who was killed in her driveway, was taken from him.\n\n\u201cAlbuquerque, where we live, is one of the most violent cities in the country. Fewer than 50 percent of homicides are solved. It is a sad irony that Jackie immigrated to the U.S. for a better life than her native Colombia only to be gunned down in her own driveway,\u201d he says. \u201cFor over eight months, there were no arrests and no leads in connection with Jackie\u2019s murder. The police were overwhelmed. They needed help.\u201d\n\nHe says helped arrived with President Trump and the FBI took over Jackie\u2019s case. He says they arrested four men in a matter of days and the fifth, the suspected killer, is an illegal alien with a criminal record.\n\n\u201cHe had been deported in September and had come back in October to terrorize our community,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI am extremely grateful to President Trump and the FBI for their efforts to deliver justice for Jackie and all the other innocent victims of violent crime. I am honored to support the President because he is supporting us,\u201d he adds. \u201cI know he will never stop fighting for justice, for law and order, and for peace and security in our communities.\u201d\n\n10:05 PM: Lara Trump says never in a million years did she think she would be on that stage tonight or with the last name Trump. She talks about meeting the Trumps for the first time: \u201cAny preconceived notion I had of this family disappeared immediately. They were warm and caring, they were hard workers, and they were down to earth. They reminded me of my own family. They made me feel like I was home.\u201d\n\nShe also testifies about seeing so many women executives in the Trump organization.\n\n\u201cSo, it didn\u2019t surprise me when President Donald Trump appointed the most women to senior level positions of any administration in history. The Secretary of the United Nations, Secretary of the Air Force, the first female CIA Director, the first African American female director of the Fish and Wildlife service and countless ambassadors, just to name a few,\u201d she says. \u201cUnder President Trump\u2019s leadership women\u2019s unemployment hit the lowest level since World War II. 4.3 million new jobs have been created for women \u2014 in 2019 alone, women took over 70% of those new jobs. Female small business ownership remains at an all-time high. And 600,000 women have been lifted out of poverty, all since President Trump took office.\u201d\n\nShe says Trump did this not to gain a vote or check the box but because it was the right thing to do.\n\nShe says this is an election if we decided if we \u201ckeep America America.\u201d\n\nIn recent months, we\u2019ve seen weak, spineless politicians cede control of our great American cities to violent mobs. Defund the police is the rallying cry for the new, radical Democrat Party. Joe Biden will not do what it takes to maintain order. To keep our children safe in our neighborhoods and in their schools. To restore our American way of life,\u201d she says. \u201cWe cannot dare to dream our biggest dreams\u2013for ourselves or for our children \u2013while consumed by worry about the safety of our families. President Trump is the law and order president\u2013from our borders to our backyards.\u201d\n\n10:00 PM: House candidate Burgess Owens says he was raised in the South during the days of KKK and Jim Crow. He says after losing everything after his NFL career, he decided he could feel sorry for himself or get to work and he did by working as a chimney sweeper. He jabs Biden for saying you ain\u2019t black if you don\u2019t vote for him says that now, more than ever, \u201cwe need leaders who stand by their principles and won\u2019t compromise their values for political opportunities. Now, more than ever, we need leaders who will stand up to the lawlessness supported by the radical left.\u201d\n\nC-SPAN\n\nHe says business ownership among people of color have hit record highs while Trump has been in office and he is just getting started.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m running for Congress because we don\u2019t need more career politicians. We need a few more chimney sweeps,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need more leaders like President Trump who understand the freedoms that make up the fabric of America.\u201d\n\n9:57 PM: Sen. Ernst says the establishment media ignored the Iowa derechos because Iowa is still flyover country. She credits Trump for visiting Iowa and putting the devastation on the national media\u2019s radar. She says she can\u2019t recall a ticket that was more hostile to farmers than Obama-Biden unless you count Biden-Harris.\n\n\u201cThe Democratic Party of Joe Biden is pushing this so-called Green New Deal. If given power, they would essentially ban animal agriculture and eliminate gas-powered cars. It would destroy the agriculture industry, not just here in Iowa, but throughout the country. When the pandemic hit, President Trump heard us in our call for assistance for our farmers. Knowing we have an ally in the White House is important.\n\nFolks, this election is a choice between two very different paths,\u201d she says. \u201cFreedom, prosperity, and economic growth, under a Trump-Pence administration. Or, the Biden-Harris path. Paved by liberal coastal elites and radical environmentalist. An America where farmers are punished, jobs are destroyed, and taxes crush the middle class.\u201d\n\nC-SPAN\n\n9:50 PM: Rep. Zeldin says the post-9/11 generation \u201chuge shoes to fill following in the footsteps of veterans like those of our nation\u2019s greatest generation who once put humanity on their shoulders and saved the world.\u201d He speaks about how his two-week-old twin daughter went into septic shock and praise the Trump administration for supporting frontline workers with PPE.\n\n\u201cFor our nation to be even stronger, more prosperous, safer, freer and more secure than ever before, to make our country greater than ever, we must re-elect President Trump,\u201d he says. We are the land of the free, because of the brave, and we are the land of opportunity right now, because we have a President who wants to empower the best of who we are, to be the best of what we can be.\u201d\n\n9:47 PM: Chen Chuangcheng says the CCP is the enemy of humanity and is terrorizing its own people and threatening the well-being of the world.\n\n\u201cThe US must use its values of freedom, democracy, and the rule of law, to gather a coalition of other democracies to stop the CCP\u2019s aggression. President Trump has led on this and we need the other countries to join him in this fight. A fight for our future,\u201d he says.\n\n9:44 PM: Jack Brewer, a former NFL player and Democrat, says his child said \u201call lives matter\u201d and he figured out what so many still have not. He rips Biden for misrepresenting Trump\u2019s very fine people words about Charlottesville. He says he knows what racism looks like and rips the media for not giving Trump enough credit for what he has done for the black community.\n\n9:41 PM: Madison Cawthorn discusses the car accident that left him in a wheel chair and gave him a one percent chance of surviving. He mentions George Washington, Abe Lincoln, James Madison all changed the world in their twenties.\n\n\u201cWhile the radical left wants to dismantle, defund, and destroy, Republicans, under President Trump\u2019s leadership, want to rebuild, restore and renew,\u201d he says. He says political forces today \u201cwant to usher in the digital dark ages, a time of information without wisdom and tribalism without truth. National leaders on the left have normalized demagoguery and a radicalized identity politics that rejects\u201d Martin Luther King\u2019s dream that draws people from across the world to the United States.\n\nHe says be a radical for our republic for which he stands and then, with assistance, stands.\n\nMadison Cawthorn stands up from his wheelchair, as he concludes #RNC2020 speech: \u201cFor our republic for which I stand, one nation under God, with liberty and justice for all.\u201d The NC House GOP nominee would be the youngest member of Congress if elected. https://t.co/Bu1ofYBbLe pic.twitter.com/lHtbMpGizZ \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) August 27, 2020\n\n9:33 PM: Rep.

She says she has lived the American Dream and talk about how she comes from a small-business family and was the first in her family to graduate from college and became the youngest Republican woman to serve in Congress.\n\n\u201cI am honored to support President Trump for re-election because I know that he is the only candidate who will stand up for hardworking families and protect the American Dream for future generations,\u201d she says. \u201cSince his first day in office, President Trump has fought tirelessly to deliver results for all Americans, despite the Democrats\u2019 baseless and illegal impeachment sham and the media\u2019s endless obsession with it. I was proud to lead the effort standing up for the Constitution, President Trump, and most importantly the American people. This attack was not just on the President, it was an attack on you\u2013your voice and your vote.\u201d\n\nShe says more women are running for Congress as Republicans because they \u201cunderstand that this election is a choice between the far-left Democratic socialist agenda versus protecting and preserving the American Dream.\u201d\n\n9:30 PM: Michael McHale, the president of the National Association of Police Officers, says good officers need to know that their elected leaders have their backs. He says chaos results when leaders make the conscious decision not to support law enforcement. He says Biden has been taken over the by the radical left and Harris has supported legislation to further restrict police that would make America\u2019s streets more dangerous. He makes the case that Trump-Pence is the pro-law enforcement candidate.\n\n9:24 PM: Legendary college football coach Lou Holtz talk about his poor upbringing in a one-bedroom house in West Virginia. He says his parents taught him to never blame anyone else but there are politicians, professors, protesters, and Trump\u2019s naysayers who like to blame others for all of their problems and don\u2019t have pride in America.\n\n\u201cWhen I was an Army officer, I served with so many great Americans who embraced their responsibility to our country. I am so proud of their sacrifice and the opportunity it has provided for so many millions,\u201d Holtz says. \u201cAmerica remains the land of opportunity no matter what the other side says or believes.\u201d\n\nHe says Trump has his trust because he is the most pro-life president in history. Hold says the Biden-Harris ticket \u201cis the most radically pro-abortion campaign in history. They and other politicians are Catholics in Name Only and abandon innocent lives. President Trump protects those lives.\u201d\n\n9:21 PM: Sister Dede Byrne talks about her untraditional journey to religious life. She joined the Army as a medical student at Georgetown in 1978 to pay for tuition and devoted 29 years to the military, serving as a doctor and surgeon in places like Afghanistan and the Sinai Peninsula.\n\nShe says that \u201cwhile we tend to think of the marginalized as living beyond our borders, the truth is, the largest marginalized group in the world can be found in the United States. They are the unborn.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs Christians, we first met Jesus as a stirring embryo in the womb of an unwed mother and saw him born nine months later in the poverty of the cave. It\u2019s no coincidence that Jesus stood up for what was just and was ultimately crucified because what he said wasn\u2019t politically correct or fashionable,\u201d she says. \u201cAs followers of Christ, we are called to stand up for life and against the politically correct or fashionable today. We must fight against a legislative agenda that supports and even celebrates destroying life in the womb. In fact, the laws we create define how we see our humanity. And we must ask ourselves, what are we saying when we go into a womb and snuff out a powerless, voiceless life.\n\nShe continues: \u201cAs a physician, I can say unequivocally life begins at conception. While what I have to say may be difficult for some to hear, I am saying it because I\u2019m not just pro-life, I\u2019m pro-eternal life and I want all of us to end up in heaven together some day.\u201d\n\nShe says she is here because Trump is the most pro-life president the country has ever seen while Biden-Harris is the most anti-life ticket ever.\n\nIn RNC speech, Karen Pence talks about art therapy helping U.S. military veterans who are suffering from PTSD https://t.co/FyLIVYDKDn pic.twitter.com/tuwE4p880q \u2014 CBS News (@CBSNews) August 27, 2020\n\n9:05 PM: White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany talks about why she decided to get a mastectomy and how Trump called to check on her after he operation. She said she had only met Trump on a few occasions but she knows him well now.\n\n\u201cThe same way President Trump has supported me, he supports you. I see it every day,\u201d she says. She says she has heard Trump say the hardest part of his jobs is writing letters to the loved ones of fallen soldiers.\n\nMcEnany where says Trump will fight for an America where \u201cGod is cherished\u201d and \u201cnot taken out of our schools, removed from our Pledge, and erased from our history.\u201d\n\n8:58 PM: Next up is Tera Myers to talk about education freedom and her child with Down\u2019s Syndrome. She says she is thankful Trump values the life of the unborn. She says Trump did not dismiss her son and showed him he valued him and gave him an equal seat at the table. She thanks Trump for their work on education freedom.\n\nMansfield's Tera Myers speaking now at the #RNC about education issues. pic.twitter.com/OiSISJVXQm \u2014 Tyler Buchanan (@Tylerjoelb) August 27, 2020\n\n8:52 PM: Ret. Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg says Trump only cares about what is \u201cright for America\u201d when making foreign policy decisions.\n\n\u201cWhen President Donald Trump took office, decades of failed foreign policy had crippled us. He faced wars without end in sight, creation of failed states like Libya and Syria, a past that allowed a terrorist caliphate to grow, and leadership in Washington that allowed our military to atrophy while we spent trillions of dollars abroad instead of investing at home,\u201d Kellogg says. \u201cPresident Trump has reversed the decline of our military and restructured our national security strategy. With historic investment and vision, our military is now better equipped, better resourced and better manned than any military in the world.\u201d\n\nKellogg also says Trump \u201cdemolished the terrorist ISIS caliphate in the Middle East and eliminated its leader, al-Baghdadi, one of the world\u2019s most brutal murderers\u201d while taking \u201cdecisive action against Iranian terrorist mastermind Qasim Soleimani\u2014a man responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American servicemen in Iraq.\u201d\n\nHe also says Trump is no hawk, wisely wielding the sword when required and believing in seeking peace instead of perpetual conflict. He then praises Trump\u2019s peace deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. He says this week, Afghan officials will start peace negotiations with the Taliban to end America\u2019s longest war.\n\n8:49 PM: Rep. Crenshaw says America has a long history of \u201cduty\u201d and \u201cour enemies fear us because Americans fight for good, and we know it gives us strength. And when our heroes are trusted and equipped, then freedom prevails.\u201d\n\nHe talks about the defeat of ISIS and the cowering of Iran being the result of America believing in heroes and her might.\n\n\u201cAmerica is a fabric woven from the threads of history\u2019s best stories, best attributes, and greatest ideas. The American spirit reflects the oldest and most important virtues: self-sacrifice, courage, tolerance, love of country, grace, and passion for human achievement,\u201d Crenshaw says. \u201cWe can decide right now that American greatness will not be rejected nor squandered. As the American founding was grounded in individual liberty, so will be our future.\u201d\n\n8:43 PM: Sen. Blackburn says America is a nation of heroes and, in times of difficulties we\u2019re reminded that they are all around us. She says she wants to talk about another type of hero, the types Democrats don\u2019t want to recognize because they don\u2019t fit into their narratives\u2013law enforcement officers.\n\n\u201cLeftists try to turn them into villains. They try to \u2018cancel\u2019 them. But I\u2019m here to tell you that these heroes can\u2019t be cancelled.\n\nTennessee is full of them\u2014after all, we\u2019re the volunteer state,\u201d she says before saying her dad served in the Army in WWII.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m reminded of him whenever I see compassion and selflessness in others,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I see law enforcement officers put their lives on the line every single day to keep our communities safe, in spite of the hatred thrown at them. When I see the heroes who volunteer to serve our country, putting their lives on the line for our freedom.\u201d\n\nShe says the common thread between them is that they don\u2019t believe the country owes them anything; they believe they owe their country.\n\n\u201cAs hard as Democrats try, they can\u2019t cancel our heroes. They can\u2019t contest their bravery, and they can\u2019t dismiss the powerful sense of service that lives deep in their souls,\u201d she says. \u201cSo they try to defund them \u2014our military, our police, even ICE \u2014 to take away their tools to keep us safe.\u201d\n\nBlackburn says Biden and Harris and their \u201cradical allies try to destroy these heroes, because if there are no heroes to inspire us\u2014government can control us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey close our churches, but keep the liquor stores and abortion clinics open. They say we can\u2019t gather in groups at church, but encourage protests, riots, and looting in the streets,\u201d she says before adding that if Democrats had their way, \u201cthey would keep you locked in your house until you become dependent on the government for everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds a lot like Communist China to me \u2014maybe that\u2019s why Joe Biden is so soft on them,\u201d she says, adding that Pelosi has said China has preferred Biden.\n\n8:41 PM: Scott Dane, a logger and trucker from Minnesota, says he represents a way of life and logging has been been part of the great American story from the beginning. He says the last time Joe Biden was in office, \u201cMinnesota lost over half of its mills, thousands of jobs, and experienced nearly a decade of decline. The administration just didn\u2019t seem to care. In 47 years in Washington, Joe Biden hasn\u2019t done anything for the timber industry.\u201d\n\nHe says under Trump, \u201cwe\u2019ve seen a new recognition of the value of forest management in reducing wildfires. And we\u2019ve seen new support for our way of life\u2014where a strong back and a strong work ethic can build a strong middle class.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to build families where we\u2019re raised and stand by communities that have stood by us,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want that way of life available for the next generation and we want our forests there too.\u201d\n\n8:31 PM: Night three opens with a prayer from Rabbi Aryeh Spero, president of the Conference of Jewish Affairs. After the pledge of allegiance, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem say she is here tonight because America is an exceptional nation founded on equality, freedom, and opportunity. She says our founding principles are under attack and this election is between a man who believes in these ideals and someone who doesn\u2019t and hasn\u2019t built anything. After citing James Madison extensively, she says Americans will not be a subclass of experts. Noem rips the violence of the mobs and says the people who can\u2019t afford to flee are left to fend for themselves.\n\n\u201cFrom Seattle and Portland to Washington and New York, Democrat-run cities across this country are being overrun by violent mobs. The violence is rampant. There\u2019s looting, chaos, destruction, and murder. People that can afford to flee have fled. But the people that can\u2019t, Good, hard-working Americans are left to fend for themselves,\u201d she says. \u201cThe Republican Party\u2019s commitment to individual rights and self-government is as necessary today as it was in 1860 when we won our first presidential election.\u201d\n\nGov.

When Keita took office, France moved counter-terrorism forces into the region while the European Union worked on training the Malian army into a more disciplined and formidable fighting force. Jihadi organizations, including the Islamic State and al-Qaeda, continued building their strength in the Sahel throughout the past decade.\n\nPolitical unrest in Mali this year included accusations that French troops stationed in Mali were engaging in \u201crowdy behavior\u201d and indulging in \u201cexcesses\u201d in the red-light districts of Mali\u2019s capital Bamako, as Malian Ambassador to France Toumani Djime Diallo put it.\n\n\u201cIt makes people afraid, it makes tongues wag,\u201d Diallo said in February. French military and government officials denied the accusations of misbehavior.\n\nKeita was re-elected to a second term in 2018, but allegations of corruption and incompetence dogged his administration, and he found a potent populist adversary in Muslim cleric Mahmoud Dicko. Dicko rallied gigantic crowds in the streets despite the coronavirus pandemic, beginning in Bamako and spreading to other cities. Keita\u2019s officials found it necessary to negotiate with Dicko even before they tried working out a deal with their elected political opponents.\n\nDicko is seen as an Islamic \u201cconservative\u201d and mystic \u2014 among other positions, he views homosexuality as a disease Mali caught from contact with the decadent West \u2014 but not a hardline fundamentalist or jihadi. He faulted Keita for allowing too much Western influence on Malian culture, and for doing a poor job of negotiating with the Sahel jihadi groups.\n\nMeanwhile, the secular opposition to Keita railed against him for allowing the economy to collapse and doing a poor job of holding terrorists at bay. The opposition first demanded Keita cede some power to a \u201cunity government,\u201d then began demanding his resignation after botched parliamentary elections, rising allegations of corruption, the suspicious disappearance of an opposition leader, a teachers\u2019 strike, and photos of Keita\u2019s son partying on a yacht while the economy collapsed.\n\nWhen he was elected, Keita pledged that \u201cKati will no longer scare Bamako,\u201d a reference to the Kati military base outside the capital city from which the previous coup occurred. Seven years later, another coup boiled out of the Kati base.\n\nMutinous soldiers drove through Bamako on Tuesday firing their stolen weapons in the air, rolled through cheering crowds of anti-government protesters, set the justice ministry on fire, took Keita and his prime minister hostage, and demanded the entire government resign. Keita complied with their demands a few hours later, after his captors ignored demands from the African Union and United Nations to unconditionally release him.\n\n\u201cToday, certain parts of the military have decided that intervention was necessary. Do I really have a choice? Because I do not wish blood to be shed,\u201d Keita said in a televised statement announcing his resignation.\n\nKeita declared he was additionally dissolving the government and parliament, as demanded by the mutineers.\n\n\u201cMay Allah help and bless Mali. I don\u2019t feel any hatred,\u201d he concluded.\n\nMan-on-the-street interviews in Bamako revealed a mixture of surprise at the speed of the coup and apathy over Keita\u2019s fate. \u201cWe did not expect this at all. It was a surprise for everyone. But since yesterday morning, in any case the population had abandoned the president,\u201d one Bamako resident told Reuters.\n\nOn the other hand, most of the international and intra-African community condemned the coup. The West African umbrella organization ECOWAS effectively blockaded Mali, the European Union declared the coup \u201ccan in no way be a response to the deep sociopolitical crisis that has hit Mali for several months,\u201d and counter-terrorist agencies braced for the awful security situation in the Sahel to get even worse.\n\n\u201cWe are following with concern the development of the situation today in Mali. The US opposes any unconstitutional change of government, whether by those on the streets or by the defense and security forces,\u201d said U.S. special envoy Dr. J. Peter Pham on Tuesday.\n\nThe next step for the coup plotters is uncertain. Leaders of the mutinous troops insisted they would hold elections and transition to a civilian government after a \u201creasonable delay,\u201d but they also set up a \u201cNational Committee for the Salvation of the People\u201d that looks a good deal like a junta.\n\nBloomberg News judged it unlikely that ECOWAS will be able to force Keita back into office or accept a transitional government led by anyone in his political orbit. Dicko\u2019s populist Islamist movement, which calls itself M5-RFP or the \u201cJune 5 Movement,\u201d will probably demand a seat at the table when any new government is formed.

The Namibian government sought to convince Germany to officially apologize for the killing of tens of thousands of indigenous Herero and Nama people between 1904 and 1908 in response to an anti-colonial uprising.\n\nGermany has repeatedly evaded the issue, refusing to issue an unreserved apology despite its admission that colonial authorities were responsible for the atrocities. Berlin is also reluctant to pay direct reparations, instead pointing to the tens of millions it has provided the country in development aid.\n\nAccording to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, German colonial officials killed as many as 80,000 people.\n\nThe Museum noted:\n\nBetween 1904-1907, German military forces, called Schutztruppe, committed a genocide against indigenous people in their colony of German Southwest Africa (present-day Namibia; hereafter, GSWA). The intent of these killings\u2014which occurred through battle; through starvation and thirst in the Omaheke Desert; and through forced labor, malnutrition, sexual violence, medical experiments and disease in concentration camps\u2014was to rid the colony of people viewed as expendable and thus gain access to their land. This genocide, the first of the twentieth century, was a prelude to the Holocaust in both the ideology of racial hierarchy that justified the genocide and in the methods employed. Such linkage between the two genocides has been termed the \u201ccontinuity thesis.\u201d Historians estimate that approximately 80,000 indigenous people were killed in the genocide.

Earlier this year, China\u2019s National Complete Engineering Corporation halted work on the $500 million Kafulafuta Dam in the Copperbelt after Lusaka delayed payments due to the Chinese firm,\u201d EXX Africa explained.\n\n\u201cIn February [2020], S&P ratings agency lowered its long-term sovereign credit rating on Zambia to \u2018CCC\u2019 from \u2018CCC+\u2019, warning that the country is vulnerable to non-payment of upcoming commercial obligations,\u201d the study\u2019s authors note. \u201cLusaka has since borrowed more, but defaulted on payments to an Italian bank, a Russian company, and other Chinese construction firms leading to stalling of projects,\u201d EXX Africa added.\n\nZambia\u2019s case serves as just one example of the larger African debt crisis, made worse by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the economic shutdowns it has caused. Africa\u2019s total debt to China amounts to $145 billion, with over $8 billion in payments owed this year.\n\nIn mid-April, international financial institutions such as the World Bank called on wealthy nations to suspend debt payments from the world\u2019s poorest countries, most in Africa, until the end of the year amid increased economic hardship during the pandemic.\n\nChina dismissed the call, insisting such a move was \u201cnot effective.\u201d Instead, Beijing said it would work with African debtor nations \u201con the basis of equality and mutual benefit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat China could do to help is bring projects funded by loans back to life and realize sustainable profits, instead of measures as simple as offering write-offs. As always, China is open to talk with debtors on the basis of equality and mutual benefit,\u201d China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement. \u201cSimply waiving debtors\u2019 obligations as some countries or organizations have called for is not going to be effective as a solution.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn June, President Xi said China would cancel interest-free debt owed by \u2018relevant\u2019 African countries as part of Beijing\u2019s move to help the continent during the Covid-19 [Chinese coronavirus] pandemic,\u201d the Daily Nation wrote. \u201cBut most of China\u2019s debt is concessional or issued by private entities meaning the credit is harder to forgive.\u201d\n\n\u201cObservers say that while \u00adBeijing has, in the past, written off most interest-free loans extended to African nations, they accounted for less than five percent of Africa\u2019s total financial debt to China, with the rest covered by concessional and commercial loans,\u201d the South China Morning Post noted of Xi\u2019s misleading promise.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/africa/2020/07/28/report-xi-jinping-refused-to-cancel-chinese-portion-of-zambias-10-billion-debt/", "published": "2020-07-28T00:00:00"}, {"title": "17,000 South Africans Die from Lack of Treatment During Lockdown", "text": "A new report by the South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC) released this week suggested that thousands of South Africans have died from ailments other than coronavirus in recent months because they went untreated due to pandemic constraints.\n\nThe study revealed a \u201chuge discrepancy\u201d in the number of coronavirus-related deaths and the number of \u201cexcess deaths\u201d from natural causes reported during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nReleased on Wednesday, the SAMRC report said that South Africa recorded \u201c17,000 excess deaths from May 6 to July 14, while 6,000 coronavirus-related deaths were reported.\u201d\n\n\u201c[T]he excess deaths could be due to other diseases such as tuberculosis or HIV going undertreated as resources were pooled together to fight the coronavirus,\u201d SAMRC President Glenda Gray said.\n\n\u201cThe numbers have shown a relentless increase \u2014 by the second week of July, there were 59 percent more deaths from natural causes than would have been expected [compared to data from the last two years],\u201d the SAMRC report asserted.\n\nOn Friday, South Africa reported a total of 421,996 infections and 6,343 deaths from the Chinese coronavirus.

Identifying the group as the \u201cBeagleBoyz,\u201d it noted that the hackers appear to install malware into global banking computer systems that allow them to access money out of ATMs.\n\nThe $2 billion estimate may mean that North Korea is generating far more money from cyber-crime in general, as the \u201cBeagleBoyz\u201d is believed to be a subsidiary of a much larger umbrella network of hackers. A year ago, the United Nations reportedly estimated that all North Korean cyber criminals had stolen at least $2 billion cumulatively, suggesting an escalation of activities in the past year.\n\n\u201cFraudulent ATM cash outs have affected upwards of 30 countries in a single incident. The conspirators have withdrawn cash from ATM machines operated by various unwitting banks in multiple countries, including in the United States,\u201d the agencies asserted, noting that some smaller banks have endured the total destruction of \u201ccritical computer systems\u201d at the hands of the hackers.\n\n\u201cThe BeagleBoyz selectively exploit victim computer systems after initially compromising a computer connected to a financial institution\u2019s corporate network,\u201d the U.S. agencies explained. \u201cAfter gaining initial access to a financial institution\u2019s corporate network, the BeagleBoyz are selective in which victim systems they further exploit. The BeagleBoyz use a variety of techniques to run their code on local and remote victim systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince February 2020, North Korea has resumed targeting banks in multiple countries to initiate fraudulent international money transfers and ATM cash outs. The recent resurgence follows a lull in bank targeting since late 2019,\u201d the security alert read. The agencies noted that the theft, in addition to its overt status as a crime, may violate United Nations sanction on North Korea over its illegal nuclear program, as the loot may be funding illegal military projects orchestrated from Pyongyang. The theft represents \u201csubstantial revenue for North Korea,\u2019 the agencies claimed.\n\nThe \u201cBeagleBoyz,\u201d the alert added, were one of a sprawling network of such groups controlled by North Korean intelligence.\n\nThe U.S. government identified itself among the nations affected by the mass thefts.

Officials do not believe all such hackers are based within North Korea.\n\nU.S. and global cybersecurity authorities have for years tracked increased North Korean hacking activity by groups affiliated with the communist regime. The alert on Wednesday suggested that the line that divides \u201cBeagleBoyz\u201d from other hacking groups is blurred: \u201cThe BeagleBoyz overlap to varying degrees with groups tracked by the cybersecurity industry as: APT38 (FireEye), Bluenoroff (Kaspersky), Lazarus Group (ESTSecurity), and Stardust Chollima (CrowdStrike).\u201d\n\nLazarus is among the most famous North Korean hacking collectives, generating significant publicity for a large cyber attack on Sony\u2019s computer network in 2014 believed to be in retaliation for Sony\u2019s movie studio releasing The Interview, a comedy mocking dictator Kim Jong-un. In 2017, a Google security researcher found evidence that Lazarus may have been involved in the \u201cWannaCry\u201d ransomware attack, which affected thousands of computers around the world. Unlike the ATM schemes, which use malware that simply secretly filter money to the hackers, \u201cWannaCry\u201d locked all the data on the affected computers and demanded their owners send money in exchange for their computers no longer being held hostage.\n\nAlso in 2017, the last year that Kim Jong-un approved a nuclear weapon test, the security firm FireEye warned that North Korean hackers appeared to be attempting to break into delicate computer systems controlling the U.S. power grid for \u201cearly-stage reconnaissance.\u201d A cyber attack on a power grid could cause significant civilian unrest and damage similar to that of a natural disaster. FireEye noted that the hacking activities did not appear to be attempting any \u201cimminent\u201d attack, only to collect information that may one day be used for an attack.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/08/27/us-says-north-korean-hackers-tried-stealing-2-billion-from-atms-30-countries-since-2015/", "published": "2020-08-27T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Rodrigo Duterte Baffles Philippines with Claim He May Have Cancer", "text": "Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said in a nationally televised speech on Tuesday that an esophageal complication he suffers from was \u201cnearing stage one cancer.\u201d\n\nThe president said his doctors advised him to stop drinking alcohol to prevent his ailment, Barrett\u2019s esophagus, from worsening.

For his efforts, the Party imprisoned Chen for seven years. He escaped in 2012, fleeing to the U.S. embassy in Beijing and ultimately to the United States.\n\nDuring his speech on Wednesday, Chen applauded Trump for confronting the Party, calling China under communism an \u201cenemy of humanity\u201d and urging Americans to vote for Trump \u201cfor the sake of the world.\u201d Chen was one of several survivors of communist regimes around the world given a platform at the RNC to tell their stories and argue that Trump\u2019s foreign policy has successfully addressed the countries\u2019 repression.\n\n\u201cWhy did the Republican Party invite Chen? Will Chen\u2019s groundless smear have any substantial effect on Trump\u2019s campaign?\u201d the Global Times, often China\u2019s most belligerent English-language outlet, asked on Thursday. The newspaper then quoted two political \u201cexperts,\u201d Party-approved Marxist professors, to disparage Chen\u2019s appearance at the event.\n\n\u201cThe [Republican] party could not find any more decent people to give a speech, nor could it find any new topic. Chen has been wandering in the US for almost 10 years since he arrived in the country in 2012,\u201d an \u201cexpert\u201d identified as Fudan University professor Shen Yi, is quoted as saying. \u201cHe has no other value for the Republican Party except to blacken China. Such slander will not have any substantial impacts on China.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe convention demonstrates that under the strong influence of the Trump administration, the whole Republican Party is turning from a party of elites into a street gang. The convention looks like a large party of third-tier talk show actors,\u201d Shen claimed. He did not elaborate on what about Chen projected a \u201cstreet gang\u201d atmosphere at the event.\n\nShen also apparently attempted to use Chen\u2019s blindness to insult the United States, saying, \u201cNow, the US is immersed in blindness as an anti-intellectual and hysterical perspective with which to comprehend China.\u201d\n\nThe other \u201cexpert\u201d the Global Times appeals to, another Fudan University scholar, did not attack Chen personally as severely as Shen. Instead, the \u201cexpert,\u201d Xin Qiang, makes the case that Republicans carefully noting that the Chinese Communist Party \u2013 not the Chinese people \u2013 is the enemy is a failed tactic because the ethnic Han Chinese people are inseparable from communism.\n\n\u201cAccording to historical traditions and customs, Chinese people tend to believe that government, country and the people are integrated. They cannot be separated. China is led by the CPC. An assault on any of these three truly hurts the feelings of the Chinese people,\u201d Xin claimed, calling Chen\u2019s speech \u201cridiculous to the Chinese people.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party regularly makes the claim that to be born Chinese is to be communist, and only \u201ctraitors\u201d and undesirables within the Chinese ranks do not support the Party.\n\n\u201cAdvocating for the separation of the CPC from the Chinese people for so-called targeted attacks is the fantasy and delusion of a few U.S. elites. It is as hypocritical and arrogant as attacking a man\u2019s heart and nervous system yet claiming to be beneficial to his whole body,\u201d the Global Times asserted in a column published in July. \u201cOpposing all CPC members is undoubtedly opposing all Chinese people.\u201d\n\nWhile not addressing Chen by name, the state newswire service Xinhua also attacked the RNC as a hotbed of anti-Chinese discrimination in a column on Thursday.\n\n\u201cOne of the most bizarre characteristics of America\u2019s 2020 presidential election is that political attacks on China have gone well beyond common sense,\u201d Xinhua claimed. \u201cThe vicious rhetoric against Beijing has hit one fresh low after another this week at the ongoing Republican National Convention.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose China hardliners in fact slapped themselves in their own faces when they were brazen enough to boast that the United States is not a racist country while constantly making ill-founded accusations against China that suggest otherwise,\u201d Xinhua asserted. \u201cSuch apparent cognitive dissonance and their wicked political motivation to scapegoat China are too obvious to miss.\u201d\n\nXinhua, like the Global Times, did not offer evidence to refute any of Chen\u2019s statements in his speech.\n\n\u201cThe CCP is an enemy of humanity. It is terrorizing its own people and it is threatening the well-being of the world,\u201d Chen told the RNC audience. \u201cIn China, expressing beliefs or ideas not approved by the CCP \u2013 religion, democracy, human rights \u2013 can lead to prison. The nation lives under mass surveillance and censorship.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe U.S. must use its values of freedom, democracy, and the rule of law, to gather a coalition of other democracies to stop CCP\u2019s aggression. President Trump has led on this and we need the other countries to join him in this fight.

U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin spoke with Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He.

He also thought the U.S. might impose restrictions that would make it difficult for China to access the international banking system, a prospective action he denounced as \u201ceconomic terrorism.\u201d\n\n\u201cDisrupting the Chinese economy is equivalent to picking a fight with the Chinese people on the food issue. China can then pick a fight with the US on the supply of medicines, right?\u201d said Li.\n\n\u201cWe are open to negotiations, but if you are unreasonable, we will fight you to the end at any cost,\u201d he added.\n\nThe actual degree of American dependence on China for pharmaceuticals and drug components is a matter of some debate. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not been able to pinpoint exactly how many Chinese companies are involved in the U.S. supply chain, or how well the American pharmaceutical industry would be able to cope if all the Chinese suppliers went offline.\n\nOne of the lingering questions is how rapidly the industry could find other suppliers or spin up domestic production, using advanced technology and innovative manufacturing techniques. The Chinese have been threatening to manipulate the U.S. drug supply ever since the trade war went badly for them in 2019, and everyone from pharma executives to the Pentagon has been aware of the strategic vulnerability that was created by allowing China to monopolize the supply chain.\n\nChina, for its part, is doing what it can to reduce its dependency on imported semiconductors, including a spirited effort to steal the technology it needs from its major suppliers in Taiwan. China\u2019s premier chipmaker, the government-funded Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC), said in early August that it believes it can achieve parity with the U.S. semiconductor industry within the next generation of computer chips.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/08/26/chinese-government-adviser-calls-weaponizing-medical-exports-against-us/", "published": "2020-08-26T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Activision Censors Tiananmen Square Footage in \u2018Call of Duty\u2019 Game Trailer to Please Communist China", "text": "Gaming giant Activision has censored a recent trailer for the latest addition to the popular video game series Call of Duty.

The company took the action to please the Communist government of China, but also removed other sections, including an interview with a Russian defector describing the country\u2019s attacks on American culture.\n\nThe game trailer features footage from a number of true-life events including USSR defector Yuri Bezmenov discussing a four-stage Soviet strategy to end American dominance in the world, including demoralization, destabilization, crisis, and normalization. Other clips include footage of the Vietnam war and the Tiananmen Square protests.\n\nEarlier this week the first version fo the trailer was deleted from Activision\u2019s YouTube channel and replaced with a new version that was about half as long as the original trailer.

As president, Mahinda Rajapaksa, who ruled from 2005 to 2015, presided over much of Sri Lanka\u2019s pivot to closer ties with the Chinese Communist Party. The New York Times has reported that evidence exists the Chinese corporation that built the seized port at Hambantota gave Rajapaksa millions of dollars.\n\nNow, under his brother, the nation\u2019s top diplomat is vowing that Sri Lanka will keep some distance from China.\n\n\u201cPresident (Gotabaya Rajapaksa) has stated that in terms of strategic security, we will follow an \u2018India first\u2019 policy. We cannot afford to be a strategic security threat to India and we don\u2019t have to be. We need to benefit from India,\u201d the Times of India quoted Foreign Minister Colombage as saying in a televised interview in Sri Lanka on Monday.\n\nColombage also reportedly described handing over the Hambantota port as a \u201cmistake.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with similar themes published by Sri Lanka\u2019s Daily Mirror on Wednesday, Colombage similarly stated that Rajapaksa seeks to assuage concerns in India that Sri Lanka has moved too close diplomatically to China. The Indian government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi has moved to distance itself from China, banning mobile phone applications made in China from use in the country and seeking to attract global companies out of China with its \u201cMake in India\u201d initiative. India and China also experienced its deadliest military exchange in half a century in July on their mutual Himalayan border, caused by Indian troops asking People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers why they were erecting tents on sovereign Indian territory.\n\n\u201cSri Lanka does not want to be caught up in the power game. Sri Lanka wants to develop friendly international ties with everybody,\u201d Colombage told the Mirror.\n\nAddressing Hambantota specifically, Colombage explained the strategic importance of the port geographically, in the heart of a major Asian trade route.\n\n\u201cThe Hambantota Port is located at the most strategic point in the Indian Ocean. That is the centre of the ocean. It is exactly in the centre between Singapore and Dubai, and Shanghai and Rotterdam as far as the distances are concerned,\u201d Colombage said. \u201cThe busiest shipping lane in the world is just 12 nautical miles south off Hambantota. \u2026 We need a port there.\u201d\n\nThe foreign minister then appeared to blame India and the former administration of Gotabaya Rajapaksa\u2019s predecessor, Maithripala Sirisena, for China taking the port over.\n\n\u201cEveryone knows, we initially offered it to India. India did not undertake it for whatever the reason. May be it was because of lack of capacity. Or, they could not take that decision at that moment. Then, it went to a Chinese company,\u201d Colombage said. \u201cWe had given the Hambantota Port on a 99-year-lease to China Merchants Port Holding Company, which India, Japan, and America considered as wrong. We actually made India jittery during the period between 2015 and 2019. But India is comfortable with President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.\u201d\n\nColombage also rejected, however, bringing Sri Lanka closer to Western free states, arguing that the bests interests of Sri Lanka require closer ties to its immediate neighbors.\n\n\u201cWe see a clear shift in the world economic order from the west to the east or Asia for that matter. Therefore, our main focus should also be on neighbourhood \u2014 South Asia, Africa, the Middle-East, ASEAN and Far East,\u201d Colombage said. \u201cWe have maintained a non-aligned policy since independence. We also see that we have been having somewhat of a Western-oriented diplomacy. We venerate the West virtually.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur foreign policy should not be tailored to what is best for another country. It should be tailored for what is best for Sri Lankans and Sri Lanka,\u201d he concluded.\n\nThe Hambantota port is, in many ways, the crowning achievement of China\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a plan to convince developing nations to allow China to build major transportation infrastructure there that they cannot afford. China offers predatory loans that the country cannot repay and, when the nation defaults, seizes what it built. The money goes to paying Chinese companies \u2014 which vow to hire locally and create jobs, but rarely do \u2014 that then seize the property.\n\nChina seized Hambantota in 2017, receiving a 99-year lease on the property.\n\nSri Lanka is currently in the middle of a strict Chinese coronavirus lockdown to prevent the virus from spreading further, significantly hurting laborers who say they cannot access jobs. In mid-August, port workers in the capital, Colombo, organized a protest demanding an explanation for why Chinese workers at the Colombo port were allowed to work without interruption, but they could not find a way to generate money, banned from the work sites.\n\n\u201cThey kept these gates closed restricting the employees while the Chinese freely roam,\u201d Kanishka Heshan, one of the protesters, told local reporters.\n\nAll the aforementioned players were pivotal to Sri Lanka\u2019s involvement with BRI. Wickremesinghe was prime minister in 2002 under an SLPP president, when Sri Lanka agreed to allow China to build to Port of Hambantota, which it lost to China in 2017. Mahinda Rajapaksa succeeded him in 2004.\n\nUnder Sirisena, Sri Lanka responded to the loss of Hambantota by signing more BRI contracts worth over $50 million, despite the fact that it could not pay back the original loan it took out nearly two decades prior.\n\nThe United States issued sanctions on several of Chinese companies involved in BRI projects on Wednesday, including the company that built the port of Hambantota, China Harbor Engineering Corp. China Harbor is a subsidiary of China Communications Construction Co. (CCCC), one of five receiving sanctions and part of 24 companies in total now restricted from doing business in America.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/08/26/sri-lankas-top-diplomat-giving-up-key-port-china-mistake/", "published": "2020-08-26T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Chinese State Media: RNC Selling \u2018Fear and Xenophobia\u2019", "text": "China\u2019s state-run Global Times propaganda newspaper derided the Republican National Convention (RNC) as a hotbed of \u201cfear and xenophobia\u201d on Tuesday, shortly before the RNC aired a live naturalization ceremony to welcome five new citizens into the American fabric.\n\nThe Global Times claimed its Communist Party-approved \u201cexperts\u201d did not believe that the RNC\u2019s focus on the damage that Beijing has done to the global economy, both with its increasingly large stranglehold on manufacturing and its inability to contain the Chinese coronavirus, would be an effective message for swing voters. One \u201cexpert\u201d claimed that only \u201cdie-hard\u201d fans of President Donald Trump could tolerate even five minutes of the RNC broadcast.\n\nThe article also contrasted the support Democrat Party presidential candidate Joe Biden received from Jeff Flake, a former Republican senator and prominent supporter of the interests of the Castro regime in Cuba, with an alleged dearth of Democrats supporting Trump. The Global Times piece was published after the first night of the convention, where Georgia state Sen. Vernon Jones, a Democrat, praised Trump for his support of historically black colleges and universities (HCBUs).\n\n\u201cThe speakers in the Republican convention tried to sell fear and hyped xenophobia to cover the Trump administration\u2019s failed handling of the COVID-19 [Chinese coronavirus] pandemic,\u201d the Global Times claimed. \u201cExperts said the event can only influence uneducated and conservative extremists, but these voters are not enough to get Trump reelected.\u201d\n\n\u201cCompared to the Democrats\u2019 national convention, the Republicans on Monday hyped fear toward the Democrats, Joe Biden, and foreign countries, including China, Muslim countries, and U.S. neighbors Mexico and Canada,\u201d the Chinese outlet claimed, quoting an alleged Chinese \u201cexpert\u201d adding, \u201cIf you are not a die-hard fan to Trump but a neutral researcher on US politics, you can\u2019t listen to those speakers for more than five minutes.\u201d\n\nThe Global Times did not cite any examples of the alleged \u201cxenophobia,\u201d particularly in support of its bizarre claim that Republicans were attempting to stoke fear in Americans towards Canada. Multiple speakers did note that China\u2019s dominance of global manufacturing was a threat to the world, and the broadcast featured a video in part blaming the failed, favorable-to-China leadership of the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) for the extent of the destruction caused by the Chinese coronavirus, but did not target ethnic Han Chinese people.\n\nWhile the RNC\u2019s Monday night broadcast featured speakers of a variety of ethnic backgrounds and at least one refugee, Cuban-American businessman M\u00e1ximo \u00c1lvarez, Tuesday\u2019s schedule following the publication of the Global Times attack focused directly on the issue of integrating new Americans into the national fabric. President Donald Trump personally presided over a live naturalization ceremony for five new citizens from Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America and the keynote speaker was an immigrant from a formerly communist country: First Lady Melania Trump.\n\n\u201cI arrived in the United States when I was 26 years old. Living and working in the land of opportunity was a dream come true but I wanted more. I wanted to be a citizen. After ten years of paperwork and patience, I studied for the test in 2006 and became an American citizen,\u201d Trump detailed. \u201cIt is still one of the proudest moments in my life because, with hard work and determination, I was able to achieve my own American dream. As an immigrant and a very independent woman, I understand what a privilege it is to live here and enjoy the freedoms and opportunities that we have.\u201d\n\nAnother \u201cexpert\u201d \u2014 identified as \u201cDiao Daming, a US politics expert and an associate professor at the Renmin University of China in Beijing,\u201d expressed particular disgust at Kimberly Guilfoyle, the national chair of the Trump Victory Finance Committee, describing her speech Monday as \u201cextremely radical and maniacal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe same socialist policies which destroyed places like Cuba and Venezuela must not take root in our cities and our schools,\u201d Guilfoyle warned in her speech. \u201cDon\u2019t let them kill future generations, because they told you and brainwash you and fed you lies that you weren\u2019t good enough.\u201d\n\nA third \u201cexpert\u201d in the article predicted that the RNC would not succeed in attracting new voters, observing without explanation, \u201cTrump and his team are playing the game according to a desperately peculiar \u2018garbage-time playbook.'\u201d\n\nThe Chinese government has formally remained silent on the convention, though confronting China\u2019s colonialism in developing countries and its ongoing campaign of espionage and intellectual property theft is a key theme of the event. The Foreign Ministry has yet to comment on the RNC, though it has resumed its regular attacks on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who spoke at the convention on Tuesday. The Global Times at press time is the only English-language Chinese state outlet openly condemning the RNC. The People\u2019s Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Party of China, published an attack on Trump\u2019s publication of his agenda for a second term in office, which occurred on the eve of the convention. The People\u2019s Daily once again condemned the Trump administration for its focus on Communist Party crimes.\n\n\u201cBy playing the China blame card, Trump is not only shifting domestic attention and attracting support, but also catering to the voices of domestic anti-China hawks and interest groups. In other words, the Republican Party has reached a high degree of consensus on Trump\u2019s policy toward China,\u201d the People\u2019s Daily claimed on Wednesday. \u201cAs the virus rages on in the US, Trump will not easily give up the tactic of blaming China because this seems to be working. If Trump is re-elected, it can be expected that he will continue to use the pandemic and other factors as excuses to suppress China.\u201d\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/asia/2020/08/26/chinese-state-media-rnc-selling-fear-xenophobia/", "published": "2020-08-26T00:00:00"}, {"title": "India: Court Says Dissident Must Apologize for Tweets or Go to Jail", "text": "A prominent government critic in India must either apologize for two tweets critical of India\u2019s supreme court or face jail time, a local court has ruled.\n\nPrashant Bhushan is a public interest lawyer who has built a reputation around challenging recent Indian governments and criticizing Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).\n\nBhushan appeared in court on Tuesday for posting two tweets which India\u2019s supreme court ruled were a \u201ccalculated attack on the very foundation of the institution of the judiciary\u201d and in \u201cserious contempt of court\u201d on August 14.

The explosion was the result of more than 2,750 tons of improperly stored ammonium nitrate igniting at the port, although the cause of the fire that ignited them is still unknown.\n\nThe catastrophic blast comes on top of an unprecedented economic and financial crisis, a currency crash and hyperinflation \u2014 the culmination of decades of endemic corruption and mismanagement by a ruling class that has refused to reform or step down.\n\nWestern nations have been demanding major reforms in the tiny country in return for help and some countries have been sending aid directly to the people rather than state institutions notorious for corruption.\n\n\u201cThis country is on the brink,\u201d Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on RTL radio, citing growing poverty, unemployment and inflation. \u201cThe risk today is the disappearance of Lebanon\u201d if it doesn\u2019t urgently form a government and institute reforms.\n\nNext week, President Emmanuel Macron is making a three-day trip to Lebanon, a former French protectorate.

Virtually every administration official except President Michel Aoun resigned soon after the August 4 explosion that devastated the city of Beirut.\n\nThe search for a new prime minister appears to be deadlocked by Lebanon\u2019s factional rivalries and resistance to reform, even as the country\u2019s already shaky economy teeters on the edge of utter ruin.\n\nReuters noted on Wednesday that Lebanon was a disaster area before the explosion, with hyperinflation devouring the currency and the banking system melting down. The current air of political chaos is making it that much harder for the country to obtain outside financial support, including from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\n\u201cIt is very dangerous now. We were at a crossroads: either the right path or continuing going down the road to no IMF, no international aid, no money. This is pushing Lebanon towards chaos, complete collapse,\u201d warned the Lebanese central bank, noting that it only has enough financial resources to keep food, fuel, and medicine flowing into the country for three more months.\n\nAfter that, Lebanon would probably have to begin cannibalizing its gold reserves to survive. Lebanon\u2019s cash reserves were valued at $30 billion in November when the central bank was struggling to convince depositors their money was secure. If the cash reserves will only sustain vital supplies and industries for three months, the $18 billion in gold reserves probably will not keep them afloat for much longer. The damage from the Beirut explosion has been estimated at $7 to $15 billion, so it could devour the value of those gold reserves with only a little left over for food and medicine.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Hassan Diab essentially pronounced Lebanon ungovernable and unreformable when he resigned a week after the Beirut blast, gravely judging the corrupt establishment to be \u201cbigger than the state\u201d itself.\n\n\u201cI hope that the caretaking period will not be long because the country cannot take that. Lets hope a new government will be formed quickly. An effective government is the least we need to get out of this crisis,\u201d public works minister Michel Najjar said after Diab resigned. That hope appears to have been dashed.\n\nMost of the officials who resigned are actually still sitting in their offices as caretakers, including Diab, and they might be sitting there for at least another year. Filling out a successor government has been stymied by the usual standoff of factional interests, as Reuters described:\n\nHezbollah and its Shia ally Amal are pressing for the return of Saad Hariri, seeing him as well placed to galvanize foreign support. But this has hit resistance from several parties, each for their own reasons. The opponents include Hezbollah\u2019s ally the Maronite Christian President Michel Aoun and his son-in-law, Free Patriotic Movement leader Gebran Bassil, who have been at loggerheads with Hariri since last year. At the other end of the spectrum, neither the Christian Lebanese Forces Party, seen as close to Saudi Arabia, nor Druze leader Walid Joumblatt want him back in the job for now. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t Saad Hariri, we will remain with a caretaker government\u201d until the end of Aoun\u2019s term in 2022, said a senior politician familiar with the thinking of Hezbollah and Amal.\n\nFor his part, Hariri is either uninterested in the job or holding out for a deal that would ostensibly break the factional deadlock and allow him to rebuild the government with a cabinet of independent experts.\n\nThe problem with his apparent enthusiasm for reform is that the other factions would justifiably expect his cabinet of \u201cnon-aligned experts\u201d to swiftly align itself with Hezbollah\u2019s interests. Hezbollah is still hell-bent on starting a war with Israel, so its interests include bombs, guns, missiles, terrorist foot soldiers, and other things the people of Lebanon cannot eat.\n\n\u201cNow, after three weeks, there has been nothing; we don\u2019t know who is in charge. Not one of the current elite has moved one inch. No one is asking \u2018what is it that we have to do?\u2019 No one is proposing anything,\u201d a former minister complained to Reuters.\n\nSeptember 1 will mark the 100-year anniversary of the State of Greater Lebanon, controlled by France until gaining independence in 1943. It is not looking like a happy anniversary.\n\nSome gloomy older Lebanese told Reuters the factional stalemates and pervasive corruption of today can be traced back to the slapdash founding of the nation, which threw several antagonistic groups together and marked out factional political territory right from the start. It seemed to be working for half a century, and then the car bombs started going off.\n\nThe biggest of those bombs took out Rafik al-Hariri, Saad\u2019s father and perhaps the last leader who had a shot at forming a durable Lebanese national identity. Now the grudges are never forgotten, and every faction clings to its power and patronage with a white-knuckled grip, fearful of making itself vulnerable by making any concessions to reform.\n\nHezbollah is the most powerful of those factions. It absolutely refuses to take any responsibility for the explosion at the port it controls, while its critics want the international community to condition rescue plans for Lebanon on getting Hezbollah out of power.\n\n\u201cFor all intents and purposes, the failed Lebanese state has become a puppet of Hezbollah and its patrons in Tehran,\u201d said a letter to the IMF from an Israeli non-governmental organization called Shurat Hadin on Thursday.\n\n\u201cHezbollah is clearly moving to control the Central Bank through its Health Ministry with the fourth largest budget in the government as well as the Communication, Agriculture, and Water ministries,\u201d warned Shurat Hadin, which represents victims of Hezbollah terrorism in both the U.S. and Israel.\n\nThe letter warned that sending billions of dollars in rescue money to Lebanon without breaking Hezbollah\u2019s grip on the financial system would amount to international support for the Iran-backed terrorist group.\n\n\u201cThe IMF is on notice that any funds it provides to Lebanon will be targeted by the victims of Hezbollah\u2019s terrorism to enforce their court ordered judgments. Any banking institutions in Lebanon or abroad that transfers IMF funds to Hezbollah will be sued in relevant jurisdictions for aiding and abetting terrorism,\u201d Shurat Hadin warned.\n\nHezbollah stated once again on Wednesday that it has no intention of relinquishing power, rejecting any political conditions on IMF support as an infringement on Lebanese sovereignty.\n\nEvery attempt to cobble together a \u201cnational unity government\u201d that would be acceptable to Hezbollah has been frowned upon by international financial donors, and frequently by Lebanese protesters, who want every trace of the government that blew up half of Beirut to disappear.\n\nThe IMF seems determined to at least secure a major reform of customs and import procedures, to ensure no other unpleasant surprises are lurking in Lebanese warehouses, but Hezbollah will never allow its smuggling operations to be disrupted. The IMF also wants a full audit of the Lebanese central bank, but Hezbollah is only one of several powerful interests that do not want the books combed over by independent auditors. Just about every significant reform proposal is a non-starter to someone with the power to scuttle any bailout deal.\n\nThe French government produced a two-page outline for a comprehensive reform plan on Thursday, a document described as ambitious but \u201cinformal.\u201d A central bank audit was reportedly one of the French action items, plus early elections to form a new government and a comprehensive, \u201cimpartial\u201d investigation of the Beirut explosion.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has conditioned aid to Lebanon on comprehensive reforms \u2014 precisely the sort of conditions rejected by Hezbollah as a violation of Lebanon\u2019s sovereignty, coming from the nation that governed Lebanon a hundred years ago.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/08/27/lebanese-politicians-fail-to-agree-on-forming-government/", "published": "2020-08-27T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Iranian Musician Charged with \u2018Encouraging Prostitution\u2019 for Working with Women Artists", "text": "Persecuted Iranian musician Mehdi Rajabian said Wednesday he was recently arrested and will face trial on charges of working with women singers and dancers in violation of Islamic law.\n\nThe 30-year-old composer says he was arrested two weeks ago in northern Iran over his latest project, which includes both women vocalists and dancers, who are effectively banned in Iran.\n\nAccording to a Rajabian, security police arrested him on August 10 and took him straight to court, where the judge accused him of \u201cencouraging prostitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis regime wants to stifle my voice,\u201d Rajabian told the BBC. \u201cThey insist that I stop playing music.\u201d\n\nMehdi Rajabian\u2013who has already been imprisoned twice in #Iran on charges relating to his music\u2013is now facing trial for working with female singers and dancers.

We are the future of the Democratic Party,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Democratic Party needs me and the communities that I come from more than we need them.\u201d\n\nCriticism of Sarsour also drew the ire of numerous Arab and Muslim activists and groups, including many that had pledged support for Biden, as well as a slew of progressive organizations and individuals, resulting in a petition that has so far garnered much support.\n\nAs a result, in an effort to avoid more controversy, Biden campaign officials rushed to assure their radical allies that the Biden campaign was with them, issuing apologies for the \u201cegregious misstep.\u201d\n\nThe apologies were no small matter, as the campaign\u2019s capitulation to the most extreme elements on the left is a sure sign of what awaits in the event of a Democratic win this election.\n\nHowever, despite the apologies, the Biden campaign\u2019s less-than-dramatic attempt to quell the outrage did little to satisfy critics on the far left, who have called for the acceptance of Sarsour and a full and open retraction.\n\nSarsour, who has a history of racist and antisemitic behavior and statements, is an organizer for Black Lives Matter (BLM) and was arrested on Tuesday along with over 60 others during a large-scale demonstration protesting the death of Breonna Taylor.\n\nSarsour also works closely with scores of other progressive organizations.\n\nA member of the Democratic Socialists of America and a popular figure in Arab and Muslim circles, Sarsour half-heartedly endorsed Biden only after he had selected Sen.

It provides a false shield for Israel\u2019s human rights abuses,\u201d the delegates said in a statement.\n\n\u201cSquad\u201d member Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Minn.) expressed her frustration of having to witness the vilification of Sarsour yet again. \u201cI am so sick and tired of folks going after Linda Sarsour and other Palestinian

Israel-boycott-promoting and anti-police organization where Sarsour serves as an advisory board member, stated that they \u201cstand with their inspirational \u201csister\u201d and \u201ccomrade.\u201d\n\nMoveOn, a Soros-funded anti-Republican PAC, called the Muslim activist a \u201cleader in the fight for justice for all of us\u201d and called for the Biden campaign to welcome progressives and Muslim and Arab Americans \u201ceven where policy disagreements exist.\u201d\n\nEmgage Action, a Soros-backed Muslim advocacy group which bills itself as the largest Muslim PAC in the country and cohosts a conference that has drawn speakers who referred to homosexuality as a \u201cdisease\u201d and defended terrorist groups, put out a statement claiming they were \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the comments made against Sarsour and demanded a \u201cspeedy and genuine retraction.\u201d\n\nCODEPINK tweeted that it stood with Sarsour and \u201cevery brave activist who speaks up for Palestinian human rights.\u201d\n\nDSA BDS and Palestine Solidarity, the national working group for Democratic Socialist members involved in BDS, expressed solidarity with their \u201ccomrade\u201d Sarsour, claiming \u201cthey smear us because they are threatened by us and the power of our movement.\u201d\n\nIn a thread calling attention to Sarsour\u2019s activism, Bend The Arc: Jewish Action, a movement of tens of thousands of pro-BDS progressive Jews all across the country, tweeted that the nearly 160 far-left members of the Jewish community \u201cfrom a range of backgrounds, experiences, and political perspectives\u201d who condemned attacks on Sarsour in the past, stand with her now.\n\n\u201cLinda, we have your back and we\u2019re grateful you\u2019ve had ours,\u201d the group added.\n\nFar-left CPD Action stated that they \u201ccontinue to support Linda\u201d for she has \u201cconsistently championed the issues that matter most to our communities.\u201d\n\nThe Soros-backed anti-Israel Jewish Voice for Peace Action launched a petition demanding the Biden campaign issue a public apology.\n\nCalling the condemnation of Sarsour \u201cunstrategic,\u201d the petition asserts that the Democratic Party needs to build coalitions \u201cwith Palestinian Americans, Muslims and those fighting for Palestinian rights,\u201d while Sarsour and her vision \u201crepresents the future we all need.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t think you can viciously smear a prominent member of our community \u2013 one who has been tirelessly working for social justice for all communities \u2013 then talk about and expect our support,\u201d Palestinian-American activist Huwaida Arraf wrote.\n\nMedicare for All activist and featured Democratic Convention speaker Ady Barkan tweeted his outrage at the criticism of Sarsour as he characterized the Biden statement as \u201cvile and dishonest,\u201d only one day after Biden thanked him for his efforts to \u201censure a more just, more equal America.\u201d\n\n\u2018Egregious misstep\u2019\n\nAs outrage grew among progressives, a fearful Biden campaign leadership sought to assuage their concerns.\n\nIn an off-the-record virtual meeting with prominent activists on Sunday, Ashley Allison, national coalitions director for the Biden campaign, stated she was sorry for comments critical of Sarsour made by a campaign spokesman.\n\n\u201cI am sorry that that happened,\u201d she said while expressing her hope to help \u201cbuild back the trust\u201d of Arabs and Muslims pained by the disavowal of Sarsour.\n\nSenior Biden adviser Symone Sanders referred to the criticism of Sarsour as an \u201cegregious misstep\u201d that harmed the work that Muslim advocates have done to mobilize the community to vote in the upcoming election while promising that such criticism would never recur.\n\n\u201cWe are not in the business of condemning people and large swathes of the community,\u201d she reiterated.\n\nBiden flip-flops on BDS\n\nDespite Biden\u2019s campaign site pledging to \u201cfirmly reject the BDS movement\u201d in an address to the Jewish community, Sanders stressed that the campaign recognises the \u201cconstitutional right to free speech on issues like BDS.\u201d\n\nAt the meeting, Biden\u2019s top foreign policy adviser, Tony Blinken, also expressed regret over the comments.\n\n\u201cHistorically, Republicans and Democrats have been quick to dismiss Muslim, Arab-American and especially Palestinian-American voices, and I want to reiterate on behalf of all of us our support for your communities,\u201d Blinken told the activists, as he pledged that the Biden campaign and future administration would ensure Arab and Muslim representation at the decision-making level.\n\nHowever, despite the efforts, the Biden campaign\u2019s apologies were deemed inadequate.\n\nPalestinian-American president of New Generation for Palestine, Amer Zahr, said the Biden aides\u2019 remarks during the meeting were not enough, calling for a public apology to Sarsour instead.\n\n\u201cA private apology, where Linda Sarsour was not even present, simply does not suffice for a very public attack on her and our community,\u201d Zahr told Middle East Eye (MEE). \u201cIf they expect our community to simply accept this backroom stuff, I\u2019m afraid they will be unpleasantly surprised.\u201d\n\nCalls for the Democratic Party to accept radical figures such as Sarsour are part of a larger aim of progressive leaders and activists who continue to criticize party policies deemed too centrist.\n\nAs a result of the latest fiasco with Sarsour as well as other moves on the part of the Biden campaign, many threatened that such moves would only work in Trump\u2019s favor.\n\n\u201cIf Joe Biden ignores, demoralizes, or actively alienates his progressive base,\u201d wrote Amy Goodman and Denis Moynihan for Democracy Now! on Thursday, \u201che could pave the way for another Donald Trump victory.\u201d\n\nAn essay in Black Star News warned that \u201cthe Biden Harris campaign could end up handing the presidency to the White supremacist president on a silver platter unless a quick corrective action is taken by way retraction of the false statement [condemning Sarsour].\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a realistic chance that November\u2019s presidential election may be decided by who wins Michigan. In 2016, President Donald Trump won the Midwestern state by a mere 10,000 votes. Michigan also happens to be home to large Arab and Muslim communities \u2013 a constituency in the hundreds of thousands that could sway the election one way or another,\u201d wrote Ali Harbos of MME.\n\nImam Khalid Latif, executive director of the Islamic Center at New York University, reiterated that in the upcoming presidential election, \u201cMuslims make up a key constituency in various swing states that Democrats will need in order to win.\u201d\n\nAs far-left progressives continue to prod the Democratic Party into adopting their objectives, radicals are already foreseeing victory as they continue to behold a Biden campaign which is desperate for their support.\n\nFounder and senior editor of Mondoweiss.net Philip Weiss welcomes the recent \u201cgrowth of the congressional Squad\u201d as the \u201cfringe\u201d that is \u201cexpanding by the day.\u201d\n\nWhile describing Biden as \u201cold and conservative,\u201d Weiss predicts that \u201cas soon as Biden is in the White House (fingers crossed), the progressives will be all over him. And they are the future.\u201d\n\nWith a Democratic Party whose \u201cbig tent\u201d is inclusive of those who continue to shift it leftward, his prediction seems all the more probable. As President Trump declared on Monday, if Biden were to win, the \u201cAmerican dream will be dead.\u201d", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/08/26/biden-campaign-capitulates-to-radicals-sarsour-we-are-the-future-of-the-democratic-party/", "published": "2020-08-26T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Turkey Bombs Yazidi Homeland Sinjar, Welcomes Hamas", "text": "Yazidi groups reported Turkish airstrikes on Tuesday in Sinjar, an Iraqi city once at the heart of the nation\u2019s Yazidi population devastated in 2014 by the Islamic State\u2019s attempted genocide of its residents.\n\nTurkey has repeatedly targeted Sinjar for bombing because of the presence of members of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), a Marxist, U.S.-designated terrorist organization that played a role in fighting the Islamic State in the area. The PKK helped local Yazidis establish a militia to prevent another attempted genocide and vowed in 2017 not to leave the area until Yazidis had full, stable control of Sinjar.\n\nThe Islamist government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan considers all groups allied with the PKK \u2013 such as the Yazidi militia they helped establish, the Sinjar Protection Units (YPS), and the U.S.-allied Syrian Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG/YPJ) \u2013 terrorist organizations and has consistently violated both Iraqi and Syrian sovereignty to attack them. Local officials in Sinjar confirmed to the Kurdish outlet Rudaw that airstrikes had occurred in the area.\n\n\u201cKhudeda Chuke, mayor of Sinune town, says a vehicle belonging to the Shingal Protection Units (YBS), a Yezidi armed group affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK) was hit in the vicinity of Bahraviyan village, seven kilometres west of the town of Khanasor,\u201d Rudaw reported. Chuke said no casualties had occurred, but that the militia lost some equipment.\n\nKurdistan 24, an Iraqi Kurdish outlet, reported that another airstrike occurred late Tuesday that killed two civilians, citing \u201cIraq\u2019s top security source.\u201d The strike occurred in another village in Khanasor.\n\nMembers of the YBS issued an official statement confirming only that airstrikes occurred, but not offering any details, instead saying they would clarify what happened at a later date when they could fully assess the situation.\n\nTurkey\u2019s state-run Anadolu news agency confirmed Turkish military activity in Iraq on Tuesday, but claimed that the military had \u201cneutralized\u201d two \u201cterrorists\u201d in northern Iraq generally. \u201cNeutralize\u201d is a term Ankara typically uses that includes both those killed and removed from battle through arrest.\n\n\u201cThe operation was carried out in the Zap region, across Turkey\u2019s border, where the terrorists were planning an armed attack, according to a ministry statement,\u201d Anadolu reported.\n\nThe Turkish Defense Ministry also claimed on Tuesday that it had destroyed PKK ammunition in \u201cterrorist hideouts\u201d in the area. Anadolu described the seizure as part of \u201cOperation Claw-Eagle,\u201d a military invasion of Iraq that Turkey launched in mid-June. Claw-Eagle consists of airstrikes on areas of Iraq that the Turkish government believes the PKK is active in, including areas like Sinjar, still largely destroyed after the Islamic State occupation there in 2014. The Turkish Defense Ministry claimed in June that Operation Claw-Eagle was necessary \u201cto ensure the security of the Turkish people and the country\u2019s borders by neutralizing the PKK and other terrorist organizations that have been stepping up harassment and attack attempts against the police and military bases.\u201d\n\nThe bombing of Sinjar on Tuesday was the first of its kind since the first round of Claw-Eagle attacks in June, Rudaw noted, adding that it has documented the deaths of at least eight civilians at the hands of the airstrikes. After the first airstrikes, PKK news sources claimed that Turkey had bombed a hospital and refugee camp, not locations of military significance.\n\nThe few minority Christians left in the Sinjar area also protested following the first airstrikes that Turkish airstrikes were targeting their homes. Rudaw quoted a local Christian named Faiza Rahim saying in June that Turkish airstrikes blew up his car and that local Christians were \u201call terrified by the bombing, including children, women, men, and elderly.\u201d\n\nTurkey also launched an adjacent \u201cOperation Claw-Tiger\u201d operation in northern Iraq in June, a ground invasion of Iraq, prompting objections from both residents of northern Iraq\u2019s autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and the Iraqi government in Baghdad.\n\nSinjar faced the brunt of the Islamic State\u2019s attempt to commit genocide against the Yazidi people in 2014. The invasion forced the residents of what was then Sinjar city to choose between confronting ISIS terrorists as they entered the city or fleeing to Mount Sinjar, which looms over the city. Many chose the latter, braving the dry mountain in hot August weather with no food or water. Many died of starvation, even as helicopter rescue missions came to try to fly them off of the mountain without having to come back down and face the jihadists.\n\nWhen Kurdish forces finally defeated ISIS in Sinjar, they returned to rubble, mass graves, and little else. Bringing electricity or basic utilities to Sinjar was impossible even a year after the Islamic State left. Jihadists left booby traps and mines throughout the city to kill those returning should they lose control.\n\n\u201cSix years on, up to 200,000 Yazidis are still displaced. Some are still facing harsh conditions on Mount Sinjar, where they fled to escape, while the majority live in camps for internally displaced persons in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq,\u201d the U.N. Development Programme noted in early August. \u201cIn addition to the human catastrophe, ISIL destroyed up to 80 percent of public infrastructure and 70 percent of civilian homes in Sinjar City and surrounding areas, as well as many important religious sites.\u201d\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/middle-east/2020/08/26/yazidis-report-fresh-turkish-bombings-sinjar-home-islamic-state-massacre/", "published": "2020-08-26T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Report: U.S. Troops Injured in \u2018Interaction\u2019 with Russian Forces in Syria", "text": "Two unnamed U.S. officials told Reuters on Wednesday that several American soldiers were injured during an \u201cinteraction\u201d with Russian troops in northern Syria this week.\n\nThe incident was described as a \u201ccollision\u201d between military vehicles that did not involve \u201cany exchange of fire,\u201d and the resulting injuries were said to be \u201cmild.\u201d\n\nReuters\u2019 sources evidently provided few details of the incident and there was no official comment from the Pentagon, but Russian television carried some footage of what was described as a \u201cskirmish\u201d between Russian and American military vehicles on August 24, while a few helicopters orbited overhead:\n\nVideo of another skirmish between Russian and US forces in NE Syria from Aug 24.

Rouhani won re-election in 2017 with over 50 percent of the vote, but much of 2020 has been filled with speculation that he could be impeached and forced out of office. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei shut down the impeachment effort in July and, now that the election schedule has been set by the Guardian Council, Rouhani will most likely reach the end of his second term.\n\nVoice of America News offered a gloomy forecast for the Iranian election year:\n\nRouhani has been under increasing pressure from the U.S. sanctions since President Donald Trump two years ago pulled America out of the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. The deal curbed Iran\u2019s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. Trump also imposed severe sanctions on Iran, sending its economy into a downward spiral. Iran is now grappling also with the Trump administration\u2019s push to impose so-called \u201csnapback\u201d sanctions over what Washington says is Iran\u2019s violation of the nuclear deal. \u2026 Iran is also facing the Mideast region\u2019s largest and deadliest outbreak of the coronavirus, with more than 361,000 registered cases, including 20,776 deaths.\n\nRadio Farda noted that \u201cunofficial campaigning for presidential election in Iran usually starts as early as the inauguration of the second term of the incumbent President,\u201d but not this time thanks to the coronavirus, economic disaster, and constant protests against the regime.\n\nRadio Farda nevertheless took a shot at handicapping the Iranian presidential race and came up with a few top-tier contenders, including newly-installed State Auditing Organization director Mehrdad Bazrpas, a former member of the brutal Basij militia; state television executive Ezatollah Zarghami; parliamentary speaker Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf; Parviz Fattah, head of the Mostazafan Foundation, essentially a giant development corporation styled as a religious charity; and Vice President for Scientific Affairs Surena Sattari.\n\nMany of those top contenders are actively campaigning for the position. Most of them are presented as \u201cyoung revolutionaries\u201d who have some reform ideas, but also solid hardline credentials, usually including ties to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the theocratic wing of the Iranian military and one of the most powerful forces in Iranian economics.\n\nOther possible candidates include former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who is becoming the Lyndon LaRouche of Iranian politics; former parliamentary speaker Ali Larijani, the longest-serving speaker and one of the most powerful politicians in Iran, although his influence waned considerably in recent years; Vice-President Es\u2019haq Jahangiri; and Mohsen Hashemi Rafsanjani, head of the Tehran City Council, who frequently urges Iran\u2019s many political factions to unite against the \u201cexternal enemy\u201d of the United States.\n\nA notable dark horse candidate is Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, one of the best-known Iranian officials internationally and among the most respected members of Rouhani\u2019s administration until recently, when the Iran nuclear deal failed to produce the benefits he anticipated and then the United States withdrew and reimposed sanctions.\n\nZarif has seemingly ruled out running for the presidency, although Radio Farda noted it is not uncommon for Iranian presidential contenders to change their minds after the elections are scheduled. Iranian election law stipulates that current officials who seek the presidency must resign from their positions three months before the election, so the firm deadline for making a decision will arrive in March.\n\nIranian Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli expressed concerns on Tuesday about the embarrassingly low turnout for parliamentary elections in February that could be repeated during the presidential race.\n\nOne of the reasons Iran\u2019s outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus was so widespread and deadly was the regime prodding people to ignore the pandemic and get out to vote, so turnout would not be so low; it still fell to the lowest levels in four decades. Fazli blamed low voter engagement levels in February on the pandemic but, in truth, most outside observers believe it was a deliberate show of no confidence in the Iranian government, driven by the killing of hundreds of protesters last year.\n\nThe clerical Guardian Council disqualifies most of the people who run for office in Iran, giving the theocracy a firm grip on true power. In 2020, the Guardian Council disqualified thousands of candidates for parliament, resulting in the lowest number of approved candidates in the history of the Islamic Republic and another major reason for the low voter turnout.\n\nPresident Rouhani was outspokenly displeased by the high number of disqualifications, especially among reformists who might have become his political allies. Literally 99 percent of reform-minded candidates were blocked by the Guardian Council.\n\nIn the 2017 presidential election, over 1,600 people applied for candidacies but only six were approved by the Guardian Council, which struck down every female and non-Muslim applicant, along with every challenger to the Iranian political establishment. Former President Ahmadinejad was one of those disqualified after making a splashy surprise entry to the race at the last minute.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/08/26/iran-schedules-june-18-election-president-rouhanis-successor/", "published": "2020-08-26T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Lebanon: Police Arrest Owner for Refusing to Leave Damaged Cafe", "text": "Police arrested the owner of a caf\u00e9 in Beirut, Lebanon, on Monday after failing to provide identification documents and refusing to vacate the premises, devastated by the massive explosion in the capital this month.\n\nRana al-Dirani, whose father is the owner of the popular Em Nazih Cafe in Beirut, filmed herself swearing at police as he was dragged out of the building over concerns that it may collapse.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned that \u201cas of now, Greece will be the only one responsible for any negative development in the region,\u201d and said the military exercise \u201cendangers the coastal and navigational safety of all ships in the region.\u201d\n\nThe escalating tension has raised concerns of potential conflict between the two regional rivals, which have come to the brink of war three times since the mid-1970s, including once over prospecting rights in the Aegean Sea.\n\nGreek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has warned of the danger of an accident when so many military vessels are concentrated in a small area at sea.

I think they will also come to see that building out this set of relationships is the pathway that will lead to stability in the Middle East as well.\n\nIn return for the diplomatic ties with the UAE, the U.S. requested Netanyahu suspend his plans to apply sovereignty over parts of the West Bank.\n\nPompeo told the Post the length of Israel\u2019s commitment not to annex would have \u201cbetter clarity\u201d when Netanyahu and Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Zayed met with President Donald Trump to sign the treaty in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll leave it to those three leaders to discuss,\u201d he said. \u201cThe commitment that the Israelis made was that they would not extend their sovereignty for a period of time.

In Der Spiegel\u2019s telling, Grechushkin chartered the ship for the ill-fated shipment of ammonium nitrate and managed the voyage, but Manoli owned the vessel all along.\n\nDer Spiegel\u2019s report further challenged the narrative that the Rhosus was on its way from Russian Georgia to Mozambique when it failed a port inspection in Beirut and got stuck there, its cargo seized after Grechushkin failed to pay its bills. Instead, the investigative report suggested many details of the Rhosus\u2019 voyage were staged or fabricated and its true purpose was to deliver the highly explosive ammonium nitrate to Hezbollah.\n\nA key piece of evidence presented by Der Spiegel to tie Manoli to Hezbollah is that unlike Grechuskhin, the Cypriot businessman has business ties in Lebanon, and in 2011 he took out a $4 million loan to buy another ship from a bank based in Tanzania called FBME.\n\n\u201cFBME isn\u2019t just any bank. American investigators have accused the institution of acting as a money launderer for Hezbollah. Another of the bank\u2019s customers was a suspected Syrian front company that had been involved in the country\u2019s chemical weapons program. It was to this bank that Manoli owed money,\u201d the article said.\n\n\u201cInternal FBME documents show that Manoli still owed the bank 962,000 euros in outstanding debt in October 2014. Manoli denies any connection between his debts and the fact that the freighter was stopped in Beirut. However, one investigator notes that FBME is notorious for pressuring defaulting borrowers into doing favors for dubious customers like Hezbollah,\u201d Der Spiegel added.\n\nFBME issued a statement for publication denying any untoward activity and denying that it sought to use the Rhosus as collateral for another loan, although it confirmed that it has done business with Manoli and his company, SeaForce Marine Ltd.:\n\nNeither FBME, the Saab family, nor their associates had any involvement with the MV Rhosus. FBME Bank did provide, in around 2012, a loan to SeaForce Marine Ltd, owned by Mr. Charalambos Manoli, for the purchase of the MV Sakhalin. This loan was accordingly secured against the MV Sakhalin, which has since been scrapped. Neither Mr Manoli nor SeaForce Marine Ltd made any repayments towards the loan, and the Bank initiated legal proceedings against them. Since the Administrators took over the Bank in July 2014, we are unaware of the current status of the case. The MV Rhosus was never collateral for the loan and FBME Bank never had any involvement either with its financing or ownership. We believe these allegations are commercially motivated and confirm that we have no relationship with Hezbollah. [Updated with statement reprinted in full.]\n\nTwo other suspicious details unearthed by Der Spiegel are that the purported buyer of the ammonium nitrate in Mozambique, a company called FEM, has been investigated for ties to Islamic terrorism, and that no one has actually stepped forward to claim ownership of the ammonium nitrate cargo \u2014 Lebanese officials never even formally confiscated it. Roughly $700,000 worth of dangerous chemicals supposedly sat in a warehouse for six years, as forgotten as the Rhosus, said to have succumbed to its many leaks and sank outside the Port of Beirut in 2018, claimed by neither Grechushkin nor Manoli.\n\nSome customs officials in Beirut did care about the abandoned cargo, and they very much wanted to get rid of it, but Der Spiegel reported that petitions to remove the chemicals were \u201csent to the wrong court so persistently that it is difficult for lawyers involved to believe in mere incompetence.\u201d\n\nThe implication is that Hezbollah wanted the substance to remain at the port so they could use it for bomb-making. As Der Spiegel and OCCRP investigators noted, there is no way to be certain all 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate were present and accounted for when the explosion struck; some of it could have been siphoned away for nefarious purposes over the years. The last time the abandoned cargo was inspected in the spring of 2020, the inspectors noticed \u201cone of the warehouse\u2019s gates was missing and there was a large hole in the south wall,\u201d but apparently no one checked to see if any of the ammonium nitrate was missing.\n\nFurthermore, European intelligence officials have estimated the stupendous explosion that horrified the world was not big enough to represent 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate blowing up. The Beirut blast appeared to involve 700 to 1,000 tons, meaning more than half of the Rhosus cargo is unaccounted for.\n\nAFP found Hezbollah in a precarious position in Lebanese politics, with public anger growing so intense after the Beirut blast that formerly untouchable leader Hassan Nasrallah has been mocked and hanged in effigy.\n\n\u201cA widely shared meme had a screen grab of Nasrallah choking back tears over the killing of Iranian spymaster Qasem Soleimani in a US drone strike in Iraq earlier this year, contrasting with another of him looking composed and smiling after the Beirut blast,\u201d AFP reported, referring to Nasrallah\u2019s emotional response when a U.S. strike killed Iranian terror mastermind Gen. Qassem Soleimani on Iraqi soil in January.\n\nThe Times of Israel (TOI) cited another report from last week that Iran provided Hezbollah with about 670 tons of ammonium nitrate in 2013. This report speculated the Rhosus cargo might not have been directly ordered or held by the terrorist organization, but instead Hezbollah loyalists working at the port might have hoarded it because they thought Hezbollah would be interested in it.\n\n\u201cA Channel 13 report earlier this month claimed Hezbollah planned to use the ammonium nitrate stockpile that caused the blast at Beirut\u2019s port against Israel in a \u2018Third Lebanon War\u2019 that may come in the future. It did not cite sources,\u201d TOI added.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/08/24/report-ties-ship-carrying-explosive-material-causing-beirut-blast-hezbollah/", "published": "2020-08-24T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Chelsea Clinton: I Want \u2018White Children of Privilege\u2019 to \u2018Erode that Privilege\u2019 Over Time", "text": "Former first daughter Chelsea Clinton said she was teaching her children to \u201cerode\u201d their \u201cwhite privilege\u201d over time during a national Women for Biden organizing call with Rep.

Kennedy\u2019s daughter. Robert Kennedy was the brother of President John F. Kennedy and served as his Attorney General.\n\nKerry is also related to Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-MA), who heads the transgender caucus in the House of Representatives.\n\n\u201cAs Chair of the Congressional LGBT Caucus\u2019s Transgender Equality Task Force, Kennedy is a leader in Washington for LGBTQIA+ rights,\u201d Joe Kennedy\u2019s website reads. \u201cHe is a proud supporter of the Equality Act and introduced legislation to ban the so-called \u2018Gay and Trans Panic\u2019 defense, as well as a resolution recognizing a national Transgender Day of Remembrance.\u201d\n\nRowling dismissed Kerry Kennedy\u2019s claim that she is ignoring the concerns of people who feel uncomfortable in their body\u2019s sex, saying:\n\nLike the vast majority of the people who\u2019ve written to me, I feel nothing but sympathy towards those with gender dysphoria, and agree with the clinicians and therapists who\u2019ve got in touch who want to see a proper exploration of the factors that lead to it.\n\nMany feminists and conservatives have cheered Rowling since she began to speak out against the transgender ideology.\n\nThe ideology says the government must accept that each person\u2019s self-declared \u201cgender\u201d is more important than their sex in a wide range of circumstances, including in sports, nude spaces, K-12 schools, teenagers\u2019 puberty, and in culture.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/health/2020/08/28/j-k-rowling-returns-award-from-pro-transgender-kennedy-foundation/", "published": "2020-08-28T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Watch: Massive Lack of Social Distancing During March on Washington", "text": "Friday\u2019s March on Washington drew thousands of people who were not social distancing during the occasion, despite the organizers promising that the event would comply with coronavirus-related health guidance and restrictions in D.C.\n\nVideo shows a massive group of people in attendance at Friday\u2019s event at the Lincoln Memorial, on the 57th anniversary of the historic 1963 March on Washington.

And always has been.\n\nMaybe for just one week we might have a reprieve from all the unhinged hateful rhetoric about how President Trump \u2014 with malice in his heart \u2014 personally killed 170,000 Americans this year.\n\nAnd that was after he somehow stole the 2016 election, got into bed with the Russians, stole Ukraine, jailed all of Mexico and is now firebombing the U.S. Postal Service so that he \u2014 now, stay with me here \u2014 can remain in power forever.\n\nWhat the Post Office has to do with any of this is anybody\u2019s guess. Crazy times, indeed.\n\nBut the loony screed goes on!\n\nEven twice-failed presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton won\u2019t shut up, offering some pretty chilling advice to Democratic nominee Joe Biden, also a twice-failed (for now) presidential candidate.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden should not concede under any circumstances,\u201d she said on a video program aptly named \u201cThe Circus.\u201d\n\nWhy anyone would listen to political advice from Mrs. Clinton is unclear.

It\u2019s been nearly four years since she lost the 2016 election and she still refuses to concede!\n\nEither way, it\u2019s pretty rancid advice during pretty rancid times. No wonder she never got elected president and the closest she ever got to the White House was on the coattails of her husband, that great paragon of virtue (especially when it came to the interns).\n\nAll this noise is (purposefully) interrupting this week\u2019s Republican convention that featured a truly gracious, elegant and self-made first lady Tuesday night. Melania Trump\u2019s speech was as clear-headed and sober as she was stunning.\n\nBut that did not prevent all the haters in the Democrat Party from accusing a world-class fashion model of dressing up as some kind of Russian dictator.\n\nThese people are nuts.\n\nAlso unveiled was the first lady\u2019s newly redesigned Rose Garden outside the Oval Office. Democrats and the bitter set in Washington were appalled that Mrs. Trump would dare update plantings left by Jackie Kennedy.\n\nThe zig-zag designs of the new boxwoods, these lunatics claimed, somehow spelled out \u201cKKK.\u201d You have to be one seriously sick racist to find such things in a garden design.\n\nBut, oh, Camelot. Shamalot.\n\nThis is as good a time as any to remind the world that it was Jackie\u2019s disgusting husband, John F. Kennedy, who instructed his young White House intern to perform oral sex on one of his top administration officials in the White House swimming pool \u2014 while JFK himself looked on.\n\nThese people were the original sickos. Even the Clintons were no match for the Kennedys in this department. Bubba was at least house-broken enough to shut the door when he was molesting the intern and defiling her with his cigar.\n\nMr. Trump, meanwhile, earned vicious condemnation from Democrats for performing a naturalization ceremony during the Republican convention.\n\nHow dare he use immigrants as props!

Doug Jones of Alabama and Rep. Steve Cohen of Tennessee \u2014 spoke to the union about fighting the outsourcing, the same number as Republicans who did so. Cohen requested that House Democratic leadership include, in a coronavirus relief bill, \u201clanguage that prohibits federal government agencies, including the TVA, from privatizing federal jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d but no such language ever materialized. [Emphasis added]\n\n\u201cWhat follows is a dark lesson about what happens when the Left ignores its historic commitment to workers,\u201d Stafford wrote, calling Trump\u2019s action against TVA \u201ca material victory for a small but not insignificant number of American workers.\u201d\n\nStafford continued:\n\nAnd just like that, Trump had saved two hundred union workers at one of the last bastions of the New Deal\u2019s legacy, and during an unprecedented global crisis to boot. An easier political victory for such a loathed figure would be hard to find. And worse, for the first time in months, the polls for November\u2019s presidential election are suddenly tightening. [Emphasis added]\n\nSurveys and poll taken this year show the public is overwhelmingly on Trump\u2019s side of the labor issue as majorities continue to oppose corporation\u2019s outsourcing of American jobs to imported foreign workers.\n\nWhile tens of millions of Americans remain jobless and underemployed, nearly 60 percent of American adults told Ipsos pollsters in July that they want to halt foreign visa worker programs \u2014 such as the H-1B visa \u2014 so that Americans are prioritized for jobs. In June, a majority of Americans, including black Americans, said there is no labor shortage.\n\nAside from ordering all federal agencies to conduct internal audits to clarify that they are not displacing American workers with imported foreign visa workers, Trump has halted the H-1B, H-2B, H-4, L-1, and J-1 visa programs to give job priority to unemployed Americans. The State Department has sought to poke loopholes in the order.\n\nAt the Republican National Convention (RNC) this week, Trump said one of his main priorities is \u201cquickly returning to full employment\u201d and invited many of the TVA workers to the speech.\n\nEvery year, the U.S. admits about 1.2 million legal immigrants on green cards to permanently resettle in the country. In addition, another 1.4 million foreign workers are admitted every year to take American jobs. Often, Americans are fired and replaced by visa workers. Many are forced to train their foreign replacements.\n\nIn June 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court reaffirmed the president\u2019s control over legal immigration. In Trump v. Hawaii, the court stated that presidents have extraordinarily broad discretion to admit or exclude foreign nationals from the U.S. when they believe doing so is in the national interest.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

All deals will be included in a public register,\u201d according to the Straits Times. \u201cThe law excludes companies but covers local councils which enter sister-city arrangements with foreign entities\u201d along with \u201cstates, territories, and universities.\u201d\n\nAustralia currently has no legislative requirement that states and territories consult with federal officials prior to arranging deals with foreign governments. Morrison said in a statement on Thursday that the Foreign Relations bill would help safeguard Australia\u2019s national interest.\n\n\u201cAustralians rightly expect the federal government they elect to set foreign policy,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cThese changes and new laws will ensure that every arrangement done by any Australian government at any level now lines up with how we are working to protect and promote Australia\u2019s national interest.\u201d\n\nMorrison\u2019s conservative government will introduce the bill to Parliament next week. Australia\u2019s leftist opposition Labor Party has indicated support for the law, meaning it will likely pass.\n\nAlthough officials have not specifically mentioned China in proposing the new law, observers say the main motivation behind the bill is the Australian government\u2019s concern that states and universities have been entering into agreements with Chinese entities at great risk to national security. In 2019, the Australian state of Victoria signed a deal with Beijing to join its infrastructure-building Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which the Chinese Communist Party uses to expand its sphere of influence. The state\u2019s decision reportedly alarmed the federal government, which may seek to use the new law, should it pass later this year, to override the plan.\n\nIn an interview with Australia\u2019s ABC Radio on Thursday, Australian Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack alluded to future action against Victoria\u2019s BRI deal with China.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been discussions between the prime minister and Victoria\u201d regarding the law\u2019s possible impact on the BRI deal, McCormack said. \u201cWe want to make sure that if there are arrangements being put in place that they are done in the national interest,\u201d he added.", "link": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/08/28/australian-prime-minister-scott-morrison-seeks-federal-powers-veto-states-deals-china/", "published": "2020-08-28T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Flashback -- Joe Biden in China: 'I Totally Understand' One-Child Policy", "text": "Joe Biden said in a speech in China while serving as vice president that he \u201cfully understands\u201d and was not \u201csecond-guessing\u201d the communist regime\u2019s brutal one-child policy, which resulted in the killing of hundreds of millions of children, mostly girls.\n\nBiden made the comments \u2013 as documented in the Obama White House digital archives and reported by Fox News and the Washington Examiner on Twitter \u2013 while speaking at Sichuan University in 2012.\n\n\u201cBut as I was talking to some of your leaders, you share a similar concern here in China,\u201d Biden said. \u201cYou have no safety net. Your policy has been one which I fully understand \u2013 I\u2019m not second-guessing \u2013 of one child per family. The result being that you\u2019re in a position where one wage earner will be taking care of four retired people. Not sustainable.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo hopefully we can act in a way on a problem that\u2019s much less severe than yours, and maybe we can learn together from how we can do that,\u201d Biden said.\n\nIn 1979, China made it illegal for couples to bear more than one child in their lifetimes, attempting to curb population growth while striving for industrialization. Women who became pregnant a second time were forced to abort. If caught pregnant late in their term, the government would still kill their child. An estimated 400 million births were \u201cprevented\u201d between 1979 and 2015 when dictator Xi Jinping expanded the policy to allow two children in the wake of a precipitous decline in the national birth rate. \u201cPrevented\u201d includes abortions and infanticides, particularly of baby girls, as boys were more traditionally desirable for couples and those who had girls chose to kill them and try again for a boy. Many abandoned infants in open-air markets, where they would die and rot in public.\n\nA feature in the Atlantic last year discussed the One Child Nation documentary, which includes interviews with an 84-year-old Chinese mid-wife, Huaru Yuan, who said she has performed \u201c50,000 to 60,000 sterilizations and abortions.\u201d\n\nThe Atlantic reported some of the gruesome details from the film:\n\nAs One Child Nation continues, the trail of horrors it depicts becomes long and winding. When China opened its doors to international adoption in 1992, many state-run orphanages became sites for human trafficking. Through her interviews, Wang learns about how newborns from families who violated the policy were kidnapped by family-planning officials and sold to orphanages, a detail that was repressed by the government (in the film, Wang speaks with a journalist who was eventually forced to flee to Hong Kong because of his reporting). To this day, many adoptees\u2014and their families\u2014find learning the truth about their origins nearly impossible. A significant number of the babies sold were abandoned by their families or given to \u201cmatchmakers\u201d for adoption. Many of the infants were girls given up by parents who hoped instead for a male child to carry on the family name. In one scene, Wang\u2019s uncle recalls the loss of his newborn daughter, who was left on a meat counter in a market and died two days later when no one took her. Another of Wang\u2019s relatives talks about how she gave away her own daughter to a human trafficker, fearing the child would die if abandoned.

Another of Wang\u2019s relatives talks about how she gave away her own daughter to a human trafficker, fearing the child would die if abandoned.\n\nChina changed its one-child policy to a two-child policy in 2015. Forced abortions and infanticide continue, as detailed in the 2017 annual report of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China (CECC), led by Sen. Marco Rubio and Rep. Chris Smith.\n\nThe Charlotte Lozier Institute reported on the revelations:\n\nThe report confirms that population planning regulations continue to exist at the provincial level that \u201cinstruct officials to carry out abortions, often referred to as \u2018remedial measures\u2019 (bujiu cuoshi), for \u2018out-of-plan\u2019 pregnancies.\u201d The report cites family planning regulations from Jiangxi and Hubei provinces and the Shenzhen municipality. Also noted are official reports from local government authorities which state that women are compelled to undergo the \u201cfour procedures\u201d which are IUD insertion, sterilization, first trimester abortion, and mid- to late-term abortion. This is cited for the following: Gu County, Guichi District, Yunyang District, Wolong District, and Dongshahe Township. Other reports have found this same abuse. The State Department\u2019s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2016 also found that coerced abortions continue to take place under China\u2019s revised Population and Family Planning Law. The law states that a citizen\u2019s \u201clawful rights\u201d should not be violated in enforcing the family planning policy, yet the State Department\u2019s report indicates that these rights are not clearly specified in the law. Also, there are seven activities listed in the law which are prohibited when officials implement the birth limit, and forced abortion is not one of them. The report notes there are regulations in Hunan, Hubei, and Liaoning provinces which require women to terminate pregnancies not in compliance with the law and confirms that these regulations have been enforced.\n\nReggie Littlejohn, founder and president of Women\u2019s Rights Without Frontiers, spoke about China\u2019s two-child policy in an interview in 2017:\n\nYes, China is not the only place where gendercide happens. But there are things that are unique to China. The main one is the coercive population control. For decades, there\u2019s been the One-Child Policy. Now China has modified its policy from a One-Child Policy to a Two-Child Policy, but the way the Chinese government announced that was very misleading. They stated that they had \u201cabandoned\u201d the One-Child Policy. The mainstream media really picked up on that word, and now people think that all coercive population control in China is over, and that\u2019s not true. They just switched it from a One-Child Policy to a Two-Child Policy. So that now every couple in China is allowed to have two children. What does that mean? That means that the entire infrastructure of surveillance and coercion are still there. Women are still having quarterly pregnancy checks to make sure that they\u2019re not illegally pregnant. They can still require a waiting period between the first child and the second child. And if you get pregnant during the waiting period, you can still be subject to forced abortion. Children can still be forcibly aborted. We had some cases that came out of China last year, 2016, where women were subject to forced abortion of third children. So coercion is continuing under the Two-Child Policy.\n\nAt the recent Democratic National Convention, the pro-abortion stance of the party \u2014 even up to the time of birth \u2014 was not a talking point, although abortion is still a part of the party platform.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter.", "link": "https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/08/28/joe-bidens-2012-speech-china-i-totally-understand-one-child-policy/", "published": "2020-08-28T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Ken Cuccinelli: Gun Ownership Will Rise If Riots Continue", "text": "Americans will increasingly resort to \u201cdo-it-yourselfism\u201d to defend themselves if Democrats fail to end leftist-driven violence and riots in Democrat-run cities, said acting Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Ken Cuccinelli on Friday\u2019s edition of SiriusXM\u2019s Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow.\n\n\u201cThe only place it is seeking normalization is in the left and the hard left,\u201d said Cuccinelli of politically-driven criminal violence and vandalism. \u201c[I have seen] Antifa polling, where half the people who self-identify as liberal think it\u2019s okay to use violence to oppose speech that you find offensive.

[China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations director Hu Shinseng] said China-India relations will see lots of ups and downs, and although India is unlikely to start an all-out confrontation against China, it will make trouble occasionally in the China-India border regions. \u201cThe optimistic attitude of some Chinese people toward China-India relations is probably based on the confidence in China\u2019s comprehensive national strength, which is much greater than India\u2019s. Normally, the stronger side would have a more confident and optimistic attitude to its relations with other countries,\u201d Hu noted.\n\nThe Chinese state media article labored to imply India\u2019s unreasoning hostility to China is born of India\u2019s ignorance, lavishing praise on Chinese citizens for how well they supposedly understand and appreciate Indian culture \u2013 their fondness for Bollywood movies and yoga exercises was specifically mentioned, although they are supposedly concerned about \u201cthe dire situation facing Indian women, such as horrific rape cases that are widely and frequently reported by international media.\u201d\n\nPoll respondents ranked India \u2013 the country they supposedly want punished for foolishly picking fights with Beijing \u2013 as their fourth-favorite neighbor after Russia, Pakistan, and Japan. This was said to demonstrate that \u201cChinese people can rationally separate the Indian government, which is provoking China, from the innocent Indian culture and people.\u201d\n\nIndia and China are still attempting to de-escalate tensions on their border, but tensions remain high, \u201cdisengagement\u201d of forces appears to have stalled, and Indian officials are accusing the Chinese of making \u201cexaggerated and untenable claims.\u201d\n\nMuch of India\u2019s messaging is aimed at convincing the Chinese they would not have an easy victory if they provoke a military conflict along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). The chief minister of Punjab, Capt. Amarinder Singh, warned on Wednesday that if China starts a war, Pakistan would soon be drawn in as well.\n\nThe Indian Express on Thursday reported a \u201cmassive Chinese build-up\u201d along the LAC, including a \u201cmassive habitat for a large troop formation,\u201d road construction, and artillery deployment.", "link": "https://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/08/28/state-media-poll-chinese-think-india-is-too-dependent-on-china/#disqus_thread", "published": "2020-08-28T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Pompeo Visits Oman in Final Stop on Middle East Swing", "text": "(UPI) \u2014 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrapped up his trip to the Middle East and Sudan with a stop in Oman on Thursday to meet with Omani Sultan Haithambin Tarik Al Said.\n\nPompeo landed in Oman\u2019s capital of Muscat where he stressed the security and economic ties between the two countries.\n\n\u201cThe secretary thanked the sultan for Oman\u2019s role in advancing peace and stability in the Gulf and the two discussed the importance of a united Gulf Cooperation Council to advance prosperity in the region,\u201d State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement. \u201cThey also discussed their shared commitment to bolstering the U.S.-Oman bilateral economic partnership.\u201d\n\nPompeo told Said he was \u201cgrateful for our strong security partnership and economic ties.\u201d\n\nJoining Pompeo and Said in the meeting were Omani Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr bin Hamad bin Hamoud al-Busaidi and Leslie M.

That and fewer people every day are interested in what pampered millionaire athletes have to say about anything.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston.", "link": "https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2020/08/28/report-several-prominent-black-nfl-players-considering-sitting-out-game-protest/#disqus_thread", "published": "2020-08-28T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Comedian Jim Gaffigan Melts Down After RNC: \u2018If Trump Gets Re-Elected It\u2019s Over\u2019", "text": "Hollywood elites were triggered following President Donald Trump\u2019s acceptance speech Thursday and perhaps none more so than actor and comedian Jim Gaffigan, who experienced a nuclear-grade meltdown on the final day of the Republican National Convention.\n\nThe comedian fired off more than 15 five-alarm tweets in which he railed against the commander in chief as a \u201ccon man\u201d and \u201crapist.\u201d He also sounded off on the subjects of cancel culture, Trump Derangement Syndrome, and virtue signaling.\n\nJim Gaffigan, whose comedy special The Pale Tourist recently debuted on Amazon Prime Video, warned of an economic apocalypse if President Trump wins re-election in November, adding that a Trump victory will mean that it\u2019s all \u201cover.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo those of you who think Im destroying my career wake up. if trump gets elected, the economy will never come back,\u201d he said in an epic tweetstorm.\n\nto those of you who think Im destroying my career wake up. if trump gets elected, the economy will never come back. \u2014 Jim Gaffigan (@JimGaffigan) August 28, 2020\n\n\u201cYou know if Trump gets re-elected it\u2019s over.

Speaking at the RNC is as political as it gets. why did you change your mind?\n\nJOHNSON: It was a great opportunity to get the message across the nation to support criminal justice reform.

Do you believe other people in the African-American community believe that he\u2019s compassionate, especially given his law and order policies?\n\nJOHNSON: Well, even law and order must be underpinned by justice and mercy. You know, and many people who I\u2019ve talked to, they are very, very compelled by what he did for me and the compassion that he showed for me. I wouldn\u2019t dare speak to what other people think.

That there\u2019s so many others who deserve a second chance and not to just look at us as being disposable because they don\u2019t see us. so every time people see my face, I hope that they\u2019re reminded of the faces of others.\n\nRUHLE: Alice, you had said you don\u2019t know what Joe Biden would do in terms of criminal justice reform.

Can i ask you, were you tested for coronavirus beforehand?\n\nJOHNSON: Yes, I\u2019ve been tested. I was tested before I went in there. So I had a mask on and the people around me who I was sitting with, they had been tested.\n\nRUHLE: Good. You know I want you to be safe, Alice.\n\nJOHNSON: Oh, yes, I know. I had my mask. As soon as I got up, I put that mask back on.\n\nRUHLE: Good. When I watched last night, I thought my girl Alice better have a mask. I want her safe.\n\nJOHNSON: Oh, I did. I had one right there.\n\nRUHLE: You had a chance, I\u2019m glad, to deliver your message to an enormous audience, to the country. What do you hope viewers took away from your speech?\n\nJOHNSON: I hope that they took away that there are many others like me who deserve a second chance and also my message to them that there is redemption. That there\u2019s so many others who deserve a second chance and not to just look at us as being disposable because they don\u2019t see us. so every time people see my face, I hope that they\u2019re reminded of the faces of others.\n\nRUHLE: Alice, you had said you don\u2019t know what Joe Biden would do in terms of criminal justice reform. Has his campaign reached out to you? And if they, do would you be opening to talking to him?\n\nJOHNSON: His campaign has not reached out to me. I would like to know everyone\u2019s plan what they have. I\u2019ve been working with the White House on what their plans on, and I feel good about them. So no one has reached out to me from his organization, from his campaign.\n\nRUHLE: Well, I appreciate all that you do every day, Alice. it\u2019s always a pleasure to see you.", "link": "https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/08/28/msnbcs-ruhle-to-alice-johnson-would-you-be-open-to-talking-to-biden-about-criminal-justice-reform/#disqus_thread", "published": "2020-08-28T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Nolte: Media Attack Trump\u2019s 3-Year-Old Grandson for Playing with Legos", "text": "Obviously frustrated over the success of the Republican National Convention (RNC), the media are now fabricating a scandal to attack President Trump\u2019s three-year-old grandson.\n\nWelcome to LegoGate.\n\nDuring her speech introducing her father at Thursday\u2019s RNC, Ivanka Trump told the story of her three-year-old son, Joseph, building a White House out of Legos and gifting it to his grandfather, who also happens to be the President of the United States.\n\n\u201cWhen Jared and I moved with our three children to Washington, we didn\u2019t exactly know what we were in for.

For four days, Republicans celebrated civil rights leaders, suffragettes, and redeemed prisoners. If this is Trump\u2019s \u201cnew\u201d GOP, it is long overdue.\n\nThe feeling of a typical Republican voter, watching all of this, was one of pride \u2014 pride in the party, pride in the president, pride in the country.\n\nFor once, the Republican Party did not portray itself as part of a counterculture, pushing back against dominant liberal themes. Instead, the RNC took the best of those themes \u2014 diversity, tolerance, compassion \u2014 and told the Republican story in those terms.\n\nBefore the RNC, there was much talk about \u201cshy\u201d Trump voters. Fewer will be shy now.\n\nBut the RNC did more than simply present the case for one side of the political argument. It also told Americans a story about themselves \u2014 a story about a strong country, a country with much to celebrate, even during what Joe Biden and the Democrats called a \u201cseason of darkness.\u201d\n\nThe fireworks display at the Washington Monument, and the opera at the White House, were audacious \u2014 and joyous. Democrats groused about the Hatch Act as the country sang along to patriotic songs.\n\nAmerica has not felt this way since the 1980s, since Ronald Reagan rescued the country from Jimmy Carter\u2019s \u201cmalaise.\u201d\n\nTrump and the Republicans didn\u2019t just appeal to an existing sense of patriotism; they helped us discover it again.\n\nJoel B.

For four days, Republicans celebrated civil rights leaders, suffragettes, and redeemed prisoners. If this is Trump\u2019s \u201cnew\u201d GOP, it is long overdue.\n\nThe feeling of a typical Republican voter, watching all of this, was one of pride \u2014 pride in the party, pride in the president, pride in the country.\n\nFor once, the Republican Party did not portray itself as part of a counterculture, pushing back against dominant liberal themes. Instead, the RNC took the best of those themes \u2014 diversity, tolerance, compassion \u2014 and told the Republican story in those terms.\n\nBefore the RNC, there was much talk about \u201cshy\u201d Trump voters. Fewer will be shy now.\n\nBut the RNC did more than simply present the case for one side of the political argument. It also told Americans a story about themselves \u2014 a story about a strong country, a country with much to celebrate, even during what Joe Biden and the Democrats called a \u201cseason of darkness.\u201d\n\nThe fireworks display at the Washington Monument, and the opera at the White House, were audacious \u2014 and joyous. Democrats groused about the Hatch Act as the country sang along to patriotic songs.\n\nAmerica has not felt this way since the 1980s, since Ronald Reagan rescued the country from Jimmy Carter\u2019s \u201cmalaise.\u201d\n\nTrump and the Republicans didn\u2019t just appeal to an existing sense of patriotism; they helped us discover it again.\n\nJoel B.

Chris Coons (D-DE), a supporter of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, about how the Biden\u2019s campaign has handled the civil unrest in cities throughout America.\n\nCoons insisted Biden had been an opponent of rioting and looting. However, MacCallum pointed out that it did not get a mention during the Democratic debate.\n\nPartial transcript as follows:\n\nMACCALLUM: So let\u2019s bring in Democrat Senator Chris Coons, also advocate for Joe Biden. Senator, always good to have you with us. Thanks for being here tonight.\n\nSEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): Thanks, Martha. Great to be with you this evening.\n\nMACCALLUM: So I hope you heard the introduction. There was a woman who called into CSPAN, which was a Democrat voter from Minneapolis. She said that she was very upset. She almost sounded like she had tears in her voice when she spoke, that the Democrats at the convention did not talk about what\u2019s happening in her city.\n\nAnd we\u2019ve seen a pretty major pivot over the past 24 hours to Joe Biden starting to bring it up and others starting to bring it up as well so what\u2019s going on here?\n\nCOONS: Well, Martha, here\u2019s what I heard in the last few minutes in Mark Meadows interview and earlier today from Joe Biden. The Chief of Staff to President Trump just said something that is flat out demonstrably untrue, and Joe Biden spoke to it earlier today.\n\nFormer Vice President Biden is clear both that he finds these incidents, like the attack on Jacob Blake, like the brutal murder of George Floyd absolutely unacceptable. He thinks these are horrible. They should not happen in the United States, and he\u2019s denounced them and has called for a full and thorough and prompt investigation.\n\nAnd he joins the family of Jacob Blake in rejecting violence in saying that protesters who are peaceful and orderly, that\u2019s terrific. That is an appropriate way in the United States to express your concerns, but when it becomes a riot, when there\u2019s violence, when there\u2019s looting, that violates our laws, and Joe Biden, and Kamala Harris do not support that.\n\nMACCALLUM: Well, to be honest with you Senator, that\u2019s exactly \u2013\n\nCOONS: Well, we just heard Mark Meadows say that \u2013\n\nMACCALLUM: Say that what?\n\nCOONS: We just heard Mark Meadows say a completely untrue thing about Joe Biden\u2019s record and where he currently stands so I appreciate the chance to be on here and to help correct that record.\n\nMACCALLUM: Yes but everything that you just said about the concerns over the shooting of Jacob Blake and the killing of George Floyd, every American shares that feeling and every American, I think \u2013\n\nCOONS: Well, I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re going to hear that from President Trump tonight, are we, Martha? Martha, are we going to hear from President Trump tonight that he has a plan, both for how we\u2019re going to heal the racial divides in our country and for how we\u2019re going to recover from this pandemic.\n\nI\u2019ll remind you the United States has 5 million infected Americans. They have \u2013\n\nMACCALLUM: We\u2019ll come to COVID, but I want to understand this topic for just a moment if I may Senator, that the fact of the matter is I covered almost every minute of the Democratic Convention. There was no discussion about the violence is happening in our cities, and that\u2019s what you heard from that Democrat voter.\n\nShe said I\u2019ve changed my mind. I can\u2019t believe that no one is talking about what\u2019s happening. The looting, the rioting. Every time I brought up the question about what\u2019s happening in the cities, I was told it\u2019s not a big deal. And you know, that it\u2019s mostly peaceful protests.\n\nWe don\u2019t have mostly peaceful protests with huge fires burning in the back of them, and now suddenly there\u2019s a recognition on the part of Joe Biden, and I think that\u2019s great. I think everybody says yes, it is time to recognize the pain of these people who have their buildings and their businesses destroyed, Sir.\n\nCOONS: Martha, it\u2019s not sudden. This is something that Joe Biden has a long record on \u2014 supporting appropriate community policing. We\u2019re being presented with a false choice here. In the United States, we should expect justice for all Americans. We should expect to live in a country where we both uphold the rule of law, where we support law enforcement, where we expect folks to conduct themselves in peaceful and lawful ways.\n\nAnd where it\u2019s unacceptable, it\u2019s not necessary to our safety and security that police occasionally conduct themselves in unlawful ways so it\u2019s the family of Jacob Blake that is joining former Vice President Biden in calling for calm and peace in Kenosha.\n\nMACCALLUM: Absolutely, we heard that from Mrs. Jackson.\n\nCOONS: It is important that the American people know that Joe Biden has a long and clear and positive record of both fighting for racial injustice.\n\nMACCALLUM: So if you \u2013 honestly, if you can find me an instance where he condemned the violence and the looting and the rioting during the Democratic Convention, I would love for you to send it to me because if it exists, I will be the first one to admit that he spoke about it at that convention, but I did not see or hear him say that, but please let me know if you did.\n\nCOONS: Martha, please play his statement from today.\n\nMACCALLUM: No, that\u2019s different. I told you, I earlier, I said that the tone is changed in the last 24 hours. I absolutely heard what he said today, so I\u2019m glad I think most people are glad that there\u2019s a recognition. I know that woman voter for Minneapolis is glad that now that\u2019s being recognized on both sides of the aisle as well.\n\nI want to ask about the debates. What do you think Nancy Pelosi was suggesting today when she said that she thought that there shouldn\u2019t be any debates and that if she were advising Joe Biden, she would tell him not to debate President Trump. Are you OK with that?\n\nCOONS: Well, here\u2019s what I know is true. Joe Biden has accepted the three debates. Donald Trump has not. Joe Biden is eager to debate Donald Trump about his record, and I hope that tonight the American people instead of just a long string of attacks on Joe Biden, some of them untrue, we\u2019ll hear a positive plan from President Trump about how he\u2019s going to deal with both the pandemic and racial inequality.\n\nNancy Pelosi is the Speaker of the House. She\u2019s negotiating with Mark Meadows. I appreciate her advice, but former Vice President Joe Biden has already committed to three debates with Donald Trump. Donald Trump, our president, has not.\n\nMACCALLUM: Well, the last I heard he was pushing for a fourth debate and I think the consortium is also interested in that and they\u2019re waiting to hear a response from the Biden campaign because in 22 days people start voting and I think both sides feel that it would be helpful if the people who start voting in 22 days have already seen at least one of these debates.\n\nSo do you believe there should be a debate prior to the beginning of voting, so a fourth debate?\n\nCOONS: There absolutely should be debates between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. The argument in the Supreme Court of the United States in which President Trump, his allies and supporters in a dozen states are going to try to repeal, what is left of the Affordable Care Act of protection for 130 million Americans with pre-existing conditions, that argument happens the week after the election.\n\nPresident Trump has talked out of both sides of his mouth about healthcare. He promised in 2016 that he would replace the Affordable Care Act with something that costs less and protect more. Instead, we\u2019ve got a system where he is still trying to take away healthcare for more than 100 million Americans.\n\nI think he should present in dignity his defense for that course of action.\n\nMACCALLUM: Absolutely, and I would love to ask him that question in a debate as well. I think it\u2019s a great question and both sides should be asked about what they\u2019re going to do about healthcare and everything else. Senator Coons, thank you very much.

He joined the administration of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi as chief cabinet secretary in 2005.\n\nAbe became the 21st president of the LDP, and the 90th prime minister of Japan, in September 2006 and resigned exactly one year later, after his party suffered huge losses in legislative elections and Abe suffered increasing complications from inflammatory bowel disease, an ailment he said he has struggled with since high school.\n\nAbe has said that only the advent of new medicines in 2009 allowed him to restore his health and return to politics. He became prime minister again in 2012 at the head of a resurgent LDP and has held the office ever since. The LDP changed its rules in 2017 to let him serve a third term as its president, and therefore remain prime minister, and it was ready to change them again so he could serve a fourth term, but Abe ruled that out in March 2019 and said he would leave office in 2021.\n\nAbe\u2019s return to the top office was followed by the launch of \u201cAbenomics,\u201d his ambitious program to increase Japan\u2019s gross domestic product while restraining inflation.

He joined the administration of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi as chief cabinet secretary in 2005.\n\nAbe became the 21st president of the LDP, and the 90th prime minister of Japan, in September 2006 and resigned exactly one year later, after his party suffered huge losses in legislative elections and Abe suffered increasing complications from inflammatory bowel disease, an ailment he said he has struggled with since high school.\n\nAbe has said that only the advent of new medicines in 2009 allowed him to restore his health and return to politics. He became prime minister again in 2012 at the head of a resurgent LDP and has held the office ever since. The LDP changed its rules in 2017 to let him serve a third term as its president, and therefore remain prime minister, and it was ready to change them again so he could serve a fourth term, but Abe ruled that out in March 2019 and said he would leave office in 2021.\n\nAbe\u2019s return to the top office was followed by the launch of \u201cAbenomics,\u201d his ambitious program to increase Japan\u2019s gross domestic product while restraining inflation.

We are not a nation of timid spirits. We are a nation of fierce, proud, and independent American patriots.\u201d\n\nTrump wants every child in America to know that they are part of the most exciting adventure in human history.\n\n\u201cNo matter where your family comes from, no matter your background, in America, anyone can rise. With hard work, devotion, and drive, you can reach any goal and achieve every ambition,\u201d he says.\n\n11:25 PM: Trump vows to make America the manufacturing superpower of the world and end our reliance on China while not getting into endless wars. Trump vows to end sanctuary cities and win the race to 5G. He promises a more ambitious space program (He says America will land the first woman on the moon and will be the first nation to plant its flag on Mars.) in addition to missile defense. He also says if he doesn\u2019t win, \u201cyour Second Amendment doesn\u2019t have a chance.\u201d\n\nTrump also promises to \u201crestore patriotic education to our schools\u201d and always \u201cprotect free speech on college campuses.\u201d\n\nTrump says this is the unifying national agenda that will bring the country together.\n\n11:22 PM: Trump says Biden is a \u201cweak\u201d candidate who \u201ctakes his marching orders from liberal hypocrites who drive their cities into the ground while fleeing far from the scene of the wreckage.\u201d He says they want to prevent school choice while sending their kids to the best schools; want to open borders while living in gated communities; want to defund the police while having armed security details.\n\n11:20 PM: Trump says we must also \u201creclaim our independence from the left\u2019s repressive mandates. Americans are exhausted trying to keep up with the latest list of approved words and phrases, and the ever-more restrictive political decrees. Many things have a different name now, and the rules are constantly changing. The goal of cancel culture is to make decent Americans live in fear of being fired, expelled, shamed, humiliated, and driven from society as we know it. The far-left wants to coerce you into saying what you know to be false, and scare you out of saying what you know to be true.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump: \u201cAmericans are exhausted trying to keep up with the latest lists of approved words \u2026 the goal of cancel culture is to make decent Americans live in fear of being fired, expelled, shamed, humiliated and driven from society.\u201d https://t.co/EyJzJDolZ4 #RNC2020 pic.twitter.com/h68yEthsCA \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) August 28, 2020\n\n11:18 PM: Trump says if Democrats want to \u201cto stand with anarchists, agitators, rioters, looters, and flag-burners, that is up to them.\u201d But the Republican Party will remain the voice of the patriotic heroes who keep America safe and salute the American flag.\u201d\n\nTrump says Biden and Democrats ignore the thousands of African-Americans killed in cities run by Democrats, but he never will.\n\nTrump says they are coming after him because he is fighting for you.\n\n11:16 PM: Trump rips Biden for not mentioning the riots at the convention and says Democrats are now talking about it because their poll numbers are sinking like a rock in water. Trump says at least 13 members of the Biden campaign donated to bail out the rioters and looters.\n\nTrump now tells the story of the late David Dorn, whose wife powerfully spoke earlier.\n\n\u201cWe are honored to be joined tonight by his wife Ann and beloved family members: Brian and Kielen. To each of you: we will never forget the heroic legacy of Captain David Dorn,\u201d Trump says. \u201cGreat man.\u201d\n\n11:15 PM: Trump says we can\u2019t allow mob rule, and the GOP condemns the rioting in cities run by Democrats like Portland, Kenosha, Chicago, and New York.\n\n15th and Pennsylvania.

They will make every city look like Portland and \u201cnobody will be safe in Biden\u2019s America.\u201d He says his administration will always stand with America\u2019s law enforcement officers. Trump introduces the story of Detective Miosotis Familia of the NYPD. Three years ago, she was ambushed and murdered \u201cby a monster who hated her purely for wearing the badge.\u201d\n\n\u201cDetective Familia was a single mom. She\u2019d recently asked for the night shift so she could spend more time with her kids. Two years ago, I stood in front of the U.S. Capitol alongside those children, and held their grandmother\u2019s hand as they mourned their terrible loss and we honored Detective Familia\u2019s extraordinary life.\u201d Trump introduces her three children Genesis, Peter, and Delilah.\n\nTrump says we must remember that the overwhelming majority of police officers are good and noble but they are afraid to do their jobs right now and thus are unable to protect the people they want to serve.\n\n11:06 PM: After ripping Biden for wanting to give lawyers and health care to illegal immigrants, Trump says Biden also \u201csupports deadly sanctuary cities that protect criminal aliens. He promised to end national security travel bans from Jihadist nations, and he pledged to increase refugee admissions by 700 percent. This is in the manifesto. The Biden Plan would eliminate America\u2019s borders in the middle of a global pandemic.\u201d He says Biden is even talking about \u201ctaking the wall down. How about that?\u201d\n\nTrump says \u201cBiden claims he has empathy for the vulnerable, yet the party he leads supports the extreme late-term abortion of defenseless babies right up to the moment of birth. Democrat leaders talk about moral decency, but they have no problem with stopping a baby\u2019s beating heart in the ninth month of pregnancy.\u201d He says Democrats \u201d refuse to protect innocent life, and then they lecture us about morality and saving America\u2019s soul\u2026.Tonight, we proudly declare that all children, born and unborn, have a God-given right to life.\u201d\n\nTrump says during the DNC, \u201cunder God\u201d was removed from the Pledge of Allegiance twice.\n\n11:05 PM: Trump says he will impose tariffs on any company that leaves America to produce jobs overseas. He says Biden\u2019s agenda is \u201cMade in China\u201d while his agenda is \u201cMade in the USA.\u201d\n\n\u201cBiden has promised to abolish the production of American oil, coal, shale, and natural gas \u2013 laying waste to the economies of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Colorado, and New Mexico,\u201d Trump then says while talking about energy issues, blaming these policies for crippling power outages in California. He says how can Biden claim to be an ally of the light when his own party can\u2019t even keep the lights on.\n\nPresident Trump: \"How can the Democrat Party ask to lead our country when it spends so much time tearing down our country?\" #RNC2020 pic.twitter.com/2g0FG03e91 \u2014 The Hill (@thehill) August 28, 2020\n\n11:02 PM: Trump says that \u201cinstead of following the science, Joe Biden wants to inflict a painful shutdown on the entire country. His shutdown would inflict unthinkable and lasting harm on our nation\u2019s children, families, and citizens of all backgrounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe cost of the Biden shutdown would be measured in increased drug overdoses, depression, alcohol addiction, suicides, heart attacks, economic devastation, job loss and much more. Joe Biden\u2019s plan is not a solution to the virus, but rather it\u2019s a surrender to the virus\u201d he says.\n\nTrump vows to \u201ccrush\u201d the virus before saying while Biden claims to be an \u201cally of the light,\u201d but when it comes to his agenda, he wants to keep us completely in the dark. He says Biden\u2019s tax hikes will collapse the economy and the stock market.\n\n10:50 PM: Trump says the Middle East was in chaos when he took office. He said he withdrew from the Iran Deal and, unlike previous presidents, kept his promise to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. After talking about the first Middle East peace deal in 25 years and obliterating ISIS and killing al-Baghdadi and Iran\u2019s Soleimani, Trump says unlike past administrations, he kept America out of wars (and rebuilding the military) and spent the last four years reversing the damage Biden did over the last 47 years. He says Biden supported NAFTA, supported China\u2019s entry into the WTO, which led to America losing one-in-four manufacturing jobs. He says voters in the Rust Belt didn\u2019t want to hear Biden\u2019s hollow words of \u201cempathy. They wanted their jobs back.\u201d He says Biden opposed killing bin Laden and cheered China\u2019s rise. He says \u201cChina would own our country\u201d if Biden is elected. He says based on good information, China wants Biden to win.\n\n10:49 PM: Trump says he has done more for the Black community than Joe Biden has done in 47 years and the best is yet to come.\n\n10:45 PM: Trump talks about ending catch and release and deporting 20,000 gang members and 50,000 criminal aliens. He salutes Border Patrol officers in attendance. He talks about taking on Big Pharma and passing Right to Try in addition to VA accountability and VA choice. He talks about opportunity zones, criminal justice reform, and funding for HBCUs.\n\n10:42 PM: Trump says Washington insiders have pleaded with him to let China steal our jobs and robbing us blind but, \u201cWe took the toughest, boldest, strongest, and hardest hitting action against China in American History.\u201d\n\nTrump said the establishment said it would be impossible to replace NAFTA, but they were wrong when he signed the USMCA trade deal into law.\n\n10:40 PM: Trump says he has done nothing but fight for you since he left his former life.\n\nThe moment President Trump walked out on stage in the South Lawn of the White House. pic.twitter.com/IHHuiQXfnp \u2014 Yamiche Alcindor (@Yamiche) August 28, 2020\n\n\u201cI did what our political establishment never expected and could never forgive, breaking the cardinal rule of Washington Politics. I kept my promises,\u201d Trump says. Together, we have ended the rule of the failed political class \u2013 and they are desperate to get their power back by any means necessary. You\u2019ve seen that. They are angry at me because instead of putting them first, I\u2019ve simply put America first.\u201d\n\n10:38 PM: Trump says Biden took the donations of blue-collar workers for 47 years and gave them hugs and kisses, told them he felt their pain, and then flew back to Washington and shipped their jobs to China and to distant lands and outsourced their dreams, offshoring their jobs, opening borders, and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars that never ended.\n\nHe says he ran for president because he could not watch this betrayal of our country and watch other countries take advantage of us on trade, borders, foreign policy, and national defense.\n\n10:35 PM: Trump says this election is about the American dream versus socialism. He says it\u2019s about protecting law-abiding citizens vs. giving free reign to agitators and criminals who threaten our citizens. He says it\u2019s about defending the American way of life or allowing radicals to destroy it.\n\nHe says at the DNC, Biden assailed America as a land of racial, social, and economic injustice. He says how can Democrats ask to lead our country when they spend so much time tearing down our country.\n\nHe says the left sees America as a nation that must be \u201cpunished\u201d for its wickedness. They say redemption can only be given by giving power to them. He says in America, we don\u2019t turn to government to restore our souls. We put our faith in Almighty God.\n\n10:30 PM: Trump \u201cprofoundly\u201d accepts the nomination for president of the United States with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism.\n\nBREAKING: President Trump accepts the GOP nomination for president during final night of #RNC2020: \u201cMy fellow Americans, tonight with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism, I profoundly accept this nomination for president of the United States.\u201d https://t.co/EyJzJDolZ4 pic.twitter.com/vrB4nAsNW5 \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) August 28, 2020\n\nHe says the Republican Party goes forward to welcome Democrats, independents, and anyone else who believes in the righteous hearts of the American people. He says we will rebuild the greatest economy in American history in the next term while defending American against all threats and protecting American against all dangers. Trump talks about reaching new heights of national achievement and a \u201cnew spirit of unity that can only be realized through love of our great country.\u201d\n\nTrump says America is not a land cloaked in darkness but a torch that lights the world.\n\nTrump speaks about the \u201cinvisible enemy\u201d and says there will be a vaccine before the end of the year and maybe even sooner. He says we will defeat the virus, end the pandemic, and emerge stronger than ever before.\n\n10:25 PM: Trump now up to speak as the audience chants \u201cUSA!\u201d and \u201cfour more years!\u201d\n\nThe Trumps walk in to Lee Greenwood\u2019s \u201cProud to be an American,\u201d a patriotic hit on country music stations since the first Gulf war. #RNC2020 pic.twitter.com/xRdwyezocx \u2014 Bloomberg QuickTake (@QuickTake) August 28, 2020\n\nTrump says he is brimming with confidence in the bright future we will build over the next four years.

She assures everyone she is not a ghost and she is free.\n\n\u201cSome say, \u2018You do the crime. You do the time.\u2019 However, that time should be fair and just. We\u2019ve all made mistakes, and none of us want to be defined forever based on our worst decision,\u201d she says. \u201cWhile in prison, I became a playwright, a mentor, a certified hospice volunteer, an ordained minister, and received the Special Olympics Event Coordinator of the year award for my work with disabled women.

But I never thought a president would,\u201d Johnson says.\n\nShe says she is using her voice to tell the stories of others like others and praises Trump for signing the First Step Act into law six months after she was freed.\n\n9:48 PM: Carl and Marsha Mueller, the parents of the late Kayla Mueller, are speaking. Carl says al-Baghdadi raped his daughter repeatedly while beating and torturing her.\n\n\u201cWe put all our faith in the government. But our government let us down. President Obama refused to meet with us until ISIS had already beheaded other Americans. To this day, we\u2019ve never heard from Joe Biden. Instead, the Obama administration hid behind policy so much that we felt hopeless when they kept us from negotiating to save Kayla\u2019s life,\u201d Carl Mueller says. \u201cThe administration showed more concern for the terrorists in Guantanamo than for the American hostages in Syria.\u201d\n\nHe says the \u201cmilitary prepared a rescue mission, but the White House delayed it. By the time it went forward, Kayla had been moved to a different location.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a difference a president makes,\u201d he continues.\n\n\u201cThe Trump team gave us empathy we never received from the Obama administration. The Obama administration said it was doing everything it could. The Trump administration is,\u201d he says. \u201cLet me just say this: Kayla should be here. If Donald Trump had been President when Kayla was captured, she would be here today.\u201d\n\n9:46 PM. Sen. Cotton says Obama\u2019s secretary of defense said Biden has gotten almost every foreign policy decision wrong and compares Biden\u2019s foreign policy record to Trump\u2019s:\n\nJoe Biden slashed defense spending again and again.

Too many of our fellow Americans are already honored at the hallowed grounds of Arlington,\u201d Cotton continues. \u201cBut if we want peace, we must be strong. Weakness is provocative. President Trump\u2019s strength has kept us out of war. Joe Biden won\u2019t stand up for America. Donald Trump will. So this November, let\u2019s stand with the president and vote to keep America great.\u201d\n\n9:36 PM: Giuliani says don\u2019t let Democrats do to America what they have done to New York. He says New Yorkers are wondering \u201chow did we get overwhelmed by crime so quickly and decline so fast.\u201d He says this \u201cunprecedented wave of lawlessness began with a truly just cause\u2013 the unforgiveable police killing of George Floyd.\u201d\n\nHe accuses BLM and Antifa of hijacking peaceful protest into vicious and brutal riots because a \u201cunified proposal to reduce police misconduct\u201d would make Trump seem like a leader.\n\nGiuliani talks about the murder of 4-year old LeGen Taliferro in Kansas City, 17-year-old New York basketball Star Brandon Hendricks, who had committed to St. John\u2019s, one-year-old Davell Gardner, Jr., who was shot and killed in a stroller at a cook-out in Brooklyn. He said these murders caused no outrage on the left.\n\n\u201cFor President Trump, and for us Republicans, all Black Lives Matter and the lives of LaGen, Brandon and Davell matter to us,\u201d he says.\n\nHe cites the murders in Chicago and presumes Black lives in Chicago did not matter to Obama-Biden. He says the crime wave will continue if Biden is elected and says this is something that cannot be solved from Biden\u2019s basement.\n\n\u201cThere is no question that this awesome job of restoring safety cannot be done from your basement, Joe,\u201d he says.\n\n9:33 PM: Police Benevolent Association President Pat Lynch of New York says the stakes have never been higher.\n\n\u201cLike cops across this country, we are staring down the barrel of a public safety disaster,\u201d he says.\n\nHe says people in the community ask him every day why so many people are getting murdered. He says \u201cthe answer is simple: The Democrats have walked away from us. Democratic politicians have surrendered our streets and institutions.\u201d\n\nHe says Democrats have passed laws that have made it impossible for police officers to work without their hands tied behind their backs.\n\nThere is nobody who hates bad cops more than good cops, but that doesn\u2019t matter to the radical left. To them, we\u2019re all bad, because we\u2019re all blue. Their anti-law enforcement campaign isn\u2019t about a single incident. It\u2019s about a message. The message is: police officers are the enemy.\n\nThe message is: criminals have the right to resist arrest. The message is: if you victimize a vulnerable person, the justice system will not hold you accountable,\u201d he says. \u201cThe criminals have heard that message, and they are taking full advantage. We must stop that message. We must expose the left\u2019s lies about police officers and the job we do.\u201d\n\nHe says while Democrats are running in fear of the mob in the streets, Trump has never apologized \u201cfor standing up for law and order.\u201d\n\n9:25 PM: Dr. Ben Carson says his heart goes out to the Blake family.\n\nBen Carson: \"Our hearts go out to the Blake family, and the other families who've been impacted by the tragic events in Kenosha.\" Full #RNC2020 video here: https://t.co/ZpNptJvTzQ pic.twitter.com/woWRKI7PlC \u2014 CSPAN (@cspan) August 28, 2020\n\n\u201cIn order to succeed in change, we must first come together in love of our fellow citizens,\u201d Carson says.\n\nHe says Trump believes in the people and is \u201cone of us.\u201d\n\nHe does not submit to political correctness or to its enforcers, the media. He is real.\n\n\u201cRight now, we need real. We need courage. We can\u2019t cower in the corner and hope that no one calls us a name, believing that will keep us safe. That is not courage, and that will not lead us to a good and just place,\u201d Carson says. \u201cWe must remember all those who sacrificed everything in order to give us freedom, and we must be willing to do the same for those who come after us.\u201d\n\nHe says Trump also doesn\u2019t dabble in identity politics and wants everyone to succeed.\n\n\u201cMany on the other side love to incite division by claiming that President Trump is a racist. They could not be more wrong,\u201d Carson says. \u201cYears ago, Jesse Jackson gave Donald Trump an award for the economic opportunities he created for Black people. In Palm Beach, Florida, Donald Trump led the crusade to allow blacks and Jews into private clubs and resorts. One of the first things he did as president was bring the Office of Historically Black Colleges and Universities into the White House so that it could get proper attention and financial support. Before the pandemic, African American unemployment was at an all-time low.\u201d\n\nCarson also touts Trump\u2019s prison reform agenda and support for school choice.\n\nCarson says what \u201cis racist is the fact that African Americans have the highest abortion rate,\u201d and he hails Trump as the most pro-life president.\n\n9;19 PM: Ann Dorn\u2014the widow of the late David Dorn, a retired police officer whom a looter murdered during the George Floyd protests in St Louis\u2013says her husband \u201chad a big smile and a heart to match. He was blessed with the gift of gab, and that gift enabled him to touch souls and inspire people, especially young people.\u201d\n\nHe says after David retired, he still befriended everyone. She talks about a young man named Lee who opened a pawn shop. Whenever the shop\u2019s alarm went off, the alarm company called Dave\u2026She says most of the alarms were false alarms:\n\nThe alarm that went off the morning of June 2nd was for real. It was a violent night in St. Louis. Four police officers were shot. Others were hit with rocks and fireworks. At least 55 businesses were damaged, looted, or set on fire. As the Officer Wellness and CIT Coordinator with the police department, I was keenly aware of the rioting and spent the evening getting ready to mobilize support for officers who were impacted. After I had gone to bed, Dave received a call from Lee\u2019s alarm company. The front door of the pawn shop had been breached. This time, he didn\u2019t wake me up to tell me. He probably knew I would have tried to stop him or insisted on going with him. As I slept, looters were ransacking the shop. They shot and killed Dave in cold blood and then live-streamed the execution and his last moments on this earth. Dave\u2019s grandson was watching the video on Facebook in real time, not realizing he was watching his own grandfather dying on the sidewalk.\n\nShe says she re-lives this horror in her mind every day.\n\n\u201cMy hope is that having you re-live it with me now will help shake this country from this nightmare we\u2019re witnessing in our cities and bring about positive, peaceful change,\u201d she says. \u201cHow did we get to this point where so many young people are so callous and indifferent towards human life? This isn\u2019t a video game where you can commit mayhem and then hit reset and bring all the characters back to life. David is never coming back to me. He was murdered by people who didn\u2019t know, and just didn\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nAnn Dorn says \u201cviolence and destruction are not legitimate forms of protest. They do not safeguard black lives.\u201d She says Trump knows we need more Davids in our communities\u2013not fewer.\n\n9:15 PM: Debbie Flood, who owns a small foundry and machine shop in Wisconsin that manufactures cast bronze architectural hardware, says she lost nearly 50% of her business to China in the mid-2000s. She wondered how a small company like hers could continue to compete.\n\n\u201cAt the time, Joe Biden was a senator,\u201d she says. \u201cHe voted to normalize trade with China and helped pave the way for them to join the WTO, even though they were hurting American companies like ours.\u201d\n\nShe says that when \u201cDonald Trump was elected, and we breathed a sigh of relief.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe actually fought for American workers and American craftsmen,\u201d she says. \u201cHe actually cared about bringing back those three beautiful words, \u2018Made in America.'\u201d\n\nShe says Biden doesn\u2019t know anything about creating jobs or business. She says he has spent 47 years in government and it is doubtful he will figure it out in year 48.\n\n9:10 PM: Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes talks about his Hawaiian, Filipino, Japanese and Spanish ancestry.\n\n\u201cMy father demonstrated his warrior spirit over 50 years ago fighting a dictator in his homeland\u2013the Philippines. Barely escaping with his life, he started anew in America,\u201d he says. \u201cHe arrived with nothing but faith, determination and a willingness to work hard. He lived the American Dream, building businesses, a family and seeing me become Utah\u2019s first minority statewide elected official. Today, I channel my warrior roots by battling human trafficking.\u201d\n\nHe says he has led some of the largest human trafficking prosecutions and \u201cPresident Donald Trump is a fierce warrior against human trafficking.\u201d He says Trump asked insightful questions and \u201cpromised to attack this evil\u201d when they met in 2017.\n\nReyes says he lost his father to cancer a few months ago: \u201cWhen he passed, he had by his bedside: his scriptures, family photos and a pen President Trump gave me to give him. Dad loved that pen. It represented freedom to him, the freedom that only exists when someone is willing to fight for it\u201d\n\n\u201cTo my father, President Trump is that ultimate warrior fighting for our freedom,\u201d he continues. \u201cIf you listen to Democrats, the media, and liberal elite, they will tell you that America\u2019s light doesn\u2019t shine as brightly around the world as it once did. That\u2019s simply not true. The same light that brought my father to America inspires the desperate and downtrodden equally today.\u201d\n\n9:05 PM: UFC\u2019s Dana White touts Trump\u2019s economic accomplishments and rails against people who want to defund the police. He praises Trump for working to bring back the economy safely after COVID hit.\n\nMMA promoter Dana White talking about \"lawless destruction.\" \"C'mon America!

He says Democrats want to defund the police and take away your Second Amendment rights. They want to give free health care to illegal immigrants and offer no protections to the unborn. He says with two more liberal Senators, we can\u2019t undo the damage they will do. He says that is why Democrats spent two weeks not saying anything about what Joe Biden will do before saying the GOP Senate is the \u201cfirewall\u201d against Nancy Pelosi\u2019s agenda.\n\n8:54 PM: Dan Scavino, who has been working for Trump for 30 years, says he never would have imagined he would be working for Trump for three decades.\n\n\u201cAll these years later, there is a part of me that still feels a sense of wonder every day when I consider the journey we have taken together \u2014 and taken with so many of you watching tonight,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause my personal story with Donald Trump, in so many ways, is your story, too. He saw potential in me. A spark. The possibility that I could be more, do more, and achieve more than even I thought was possible. That\u2019s how he views this country, too. We have all just scratched the surface of what we can do together.\u201d\n\nHe says if there is one thing viewers take away from him tonight, \u201cit is this\u2013President Trump is a kind and decent man. I wish you could be at his side with me to see his endless kindness to everyone he meets.\u201d\n\nBiden Campaign commercial airs while Fox cuts coverage from Scavino\u2019s speech pic.twitter.com/8hbN8ieltk \u2014 Acyn Torabi (@Acyn) August 28, 2020\n\nHe says Trump can\u2019t be bought, bullied, or beaten.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is the first leader who\u2019s been too strong, too tough, and too savvy to be crushed by the status quo establishment and the political media class,\u201d he says before saying what they call \u201cchaos,\u201d Trump calls \u201cchange.\u201d\n\nHe says Trump is a man of the people and points out the RNC featured real Americans \u201cwho are just like us.\u201d\n\n8:51 PM: Stacia Brightmon talks about having been homeless and finding out about from the Texas Workforce Commission about S&B\u2019s Women in Construction Earn-While-You-Learn apprenticeship program. She says President Trump backed \u201cpolicies that made it easy for states and companies to give opportunities to hardworking Americans\u201d like her.\n\nC-SPAN\n\n8:45 PM: Rep. Jeff Van Drew says how he became a Republican says a lot about today\u2019s Democrats. He says Democrats had become less accepting of American traditions and exceptionalism. He says it was not the party he knew and says his first vote in the House was against the San Francisco liberal for House Speaker. He says, with the Squad, Democrats went from being liberal to radical and were no longer about just raising taxes. They were also for open borders. He says he voted no on impeachment and met with Trump soon after and the president made him feel more comfortable than Pelosi made him feel in her caucus. He says he then became a Republican a few days later. He says when Democrats tried to order him around, he said he had had enough with their radical, socialist agenda. He says Biden \u201cis being told what to do by the radicals running my former party.\u201d\n\nJeff Van Drew said during Impeachment proceedings Democrats told him to fall in line or lose reelection. \u201cListen, I\u2019m from South Jersey and you better come at me with more than loud words and empty threats.

He said he didn\u2019t know a Republican growing up and believed all the stereotypes. He says Trump cares about every issue important to Black communities and talks about Trump\u2019s funding for HBCUs and fight for school choice. He says he has shown the \u201cdeep empathy\u201d Trump has shown the families who have been killed by senseless violence after mentioning the deaths of George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery. He says Trump has a lot of Cleveland in him for a New Yorker.\n\nWhite House advisor Ja'Ron Smith: \"Growing up, I'd never really known a Republican. I believed all the stereotypes.

Americans are exhausted trying to keep up with the latest list of approved words and phrases, and the ever-more restrictive political decrees. Many things have a different name now, and the rules are constantly changing.

He promised to end national security travel bans from Jihadist nations, and he pledged to increase refugee admissions by 700 percent. This is in the manifesto. The Biden Plan would eliminate America\u2019s borders in the middle of a global pandemic.\u201d He says Biden is even talking about \u201ctaking the wall down.

Democrat leaders talk about moral decency, but they have no problem with stopping a baby\u2019s beating heart in the ninth month of pregnancy.\u201d He says Democrats \u201d refuse to protect innocent life, and then they lecture us about morality and saving America\u2019s soul\u2026.Tonight, we proudly declare that all children, born and unborn, have a God-given right to life.\u201d\n\nTrump says during the DNC, \u201cunder God\u201d was removed from the Pledge of Allegiance twice.\n\n11:05 PM: Trump says he will impose tariffs on any company that leaves America to produce jobs overseas. He says Biden\u2019s agenda is \u201cMade in China\u201d while his agenda is \u201cMade in the USA.\u201d\n\n\u201cBiden has promised to abolish the production of American oil, coal, shale, and natural gas \u2013 laying waste to the economies of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Colorado, and New Mexico,\u201d Trump then says while talking about energy issues, blaming these policies for crippling power outages in California. He says how can Biden claim to be an ally of the light when his own party can\u2019t even keep the lights on.\n\nPresident Trump: \"How can the Democrat Party ask to lead our country when it spends so much time tearing down our country?\" #RNC2020 pic.twitter.com/2g0FG03e91 \u2014 The Hill (@thehill) August 28, 2020\n\n11:02 PM: Trump says that \u201cinstead of following the science, Joe Biden wants to inflict a painful shutdown on the entire country. His shutdown would inflict unthinkable and lasting harm on our nation\u2019s children, families, and citizens of all backgrounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe cost of the Biden shutdown would be measured in increased drug overdoses, depression, alcohol addiction, suicides, heart attacks, economic devastation, job loss and much more. Joe Biden\u2019s plan is not a solution to the virus, but rather it\u2019s a surrender to the virus\u201d he says.\n\nTrump vows to \u201ccrush\u201d the virus before saying while Biden claims to be an \u201cally of the light,\u201d but when it comes to his agenda, he wants to keep us completely in the dark. He says Biden\u2019s tax hikes will collapse the economy and the stock market.\n\n10:50 PM: Trump says the Middle East was in chaos when he took office. He said he withdrew from the Iran Deal and, unlike previous presidents, kept his promise to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. After talking about the first Middle East peace deal in 25 years and obliterating ISIS and killing al-Baghdadi and Iran\u2019s Soleimani, Trump says unlike past administrations, he kept America out of wars (and rebuilding the military) and spent the last four years reversing the damage Biden did over the last 47 years. He says Biden supported NAFTA, supported China\u2019s entry into the WTO, which led to America losing one-in-four manufacturing jobs. He says voters in the Rust Belt didn\u2019t want to hear Biden\u2019s hollow words of \u201cempathy. They wanted their jobs back.\u201d He says Biden opposed killing bin Laden and cheered China\u2019s rise. He says \u201cChina would own our country\u201d if Biden is elected. He says based on good information, China wants Biden to win.\n\n10:49 PM: Trump says he has done more for the Black community than Joe Biden has done in 47 years and the best is yet to come.\n\n10:45 PM: Trump talks about ending catch and release and deporting 20,000 gang members and 50,000 criminal aliens. He salutes Border Patrol officers in attendance. He talks about taking on Big Pharma and passing Right to Try in addition to VA accountability and VA choice. He talks about opportunity zones, criminal justice reform, and funding for HBCUs.\n\n10:42 PM: Trump says Washington insiders have pleaded with him to let China steal our jobs and robbing us blind but, \u201cWe took the toughest, boldest, strongest, and hardest hitting action against China in American History.\u201d\n\nTrump said the establishment said it would be impossible to replace NAFTA, but they were wrong when he signed the USMCA trade deal into law.\n\n10:40 PM: Trump says he has done nothing but fight for you since he left his former life.\n\nThe moment President Trump walked out on stage in the South Lawn of the White House. pic.twitter.com/IHHuiQXfnp \u2014 Yamiche Alcindor (@Yamiche) August 28, 2020\n\n\u201cI did what our political establishment never expected and could never forgive, breaking the cardinal rule of Washington Politics. I kept my promises,\u201d Trump says. Together, we have ended the rule of the failed political class \u2013 and they are desperate to get their power back by any means necessary. You\u2019ve seen that. They are angry at me because instead of putting them first, I\u2019ve simply put America first.\u201d\n\n10:38 PM: Trump says Biden took the donations of blue-collar workers for 47 years and gave them hugs and kisses, told them he felt their pain, and then flew back to Washington and shipped their jobs to China and to distant lands and outsourced their dreams, offshoring their jobs, opening borders, and sending their sons and daughters to fight in endless foreign wars that never ended.\n\nHe says he ran for president because he could not watch this betrayal of our country and watch other countries take advantage of us on trade, borders, foreign policy, and national defense.\n\n10:35 PM: Trump says this election is about the American dream versus socialism. He says it\u2019s about protecting law-abiding citizens vs. giving free reign to agitators and criminals who threaten our citizens. He says it\u2019s about defending the American way of life or allowing radicals to destroy it.\n\nHe says at the DNC, Biden assailed America as a land of racial, social, and economic injustice. He says how can Democrats ask to lead our country when they spend so much time tearing down our country.\n\nHe says the left sees America as a nation that must be \u201cpunished\u201d for its wickedness. They say redemption can only be given by giving power to them. He says in America, we don\u2019t turn to government to restore our souls. We put our faith in Almighty God.\n\n10:30 PM: Trump \u201cprofoundly\u201d accepts the nomination for president of the United States with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism.\n\nBREAKING: President Trump accepts the GOP nomination for president during final night of #RNC2020: \u201cMy fellow Americans, tonight with a heart full of gratitude and boundless optimism, I profoundly accept this nomination for president of the United States.\u201d https://t.co/EyJzJDolZ4 pic.twitter.com/vrB4nAsNW5 \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) August 28, 2020\n\nHe says the Republican Party goes forward to welcome Democrats, independents, and anyone else who believes in the righteous hearts of the American people. He says we will rebuild the greatest economy in American history in the next term while defending American against all threats and protecting American against all dangers. Trump talks about reaching new heights of national achievement and a \u201cnew spirit of unity that can only be realized through love of our great country.\u201d\n\nTrump says America is not a land cloaked in darkness but a torch that lights the world.\n\nTrump speaks about the \u201cinvisible enemy\u201d and says there will be a vaccine before the end of the year and maybe even sooner. He says we will defeat the virus, end the pandemic, and emerge stronger than ever before.\n\n10:25 PM: Trump now up to speak as the audience chants \u201cUSA!\u201d and \u201cfour more years!\u201d\n\nThe Trumps walk in to Lee Greenwood\u2019s \u201cProud to be an American,\u201d a patriotic hit on country music stations since the first Gulf war. #RNC2020 pic.twitter.com/xRdwyezocx \u2014 Bloomberg QuickTake (@QuickTake) August 28, 2020\n\nTrump says he is brimming with confidence in the bright future we will build over the next four years.

She assures everyone she is not a ghost and she is free.\n\n\u201cSome say, \u2018You do the crime. You do the time.\u2019 However, that time should be fair and just. We\u2019ve all made mistakes, and none of us want to be defined forever based on our worst decision,\u201d she says. \u201cWhile in prison, I became a playwright, a mentor, a certified hospice volunteer, an ordained minister, and received the Special Olympics Event Coordinator of the year award for my work with disabled women. Because the only thing worse than unjustly imprisoning my body, is trying to imprison my mind.\u201d\n\nShe says her transformation was described as extraordinary and her Christian faith and the prayers of so many kept hope alive.\n\nShe says Trump had compassion and acted when he heard her story.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it. I always remembered that God knew my name, even in my darkest hour. But I never thought a president would,\u201d Johnson says.\n\nShe says she is using her voice to tell the stories of others like others and praises Trump for signing the First Step Act into law six months after she was freed.\n\n9:48 PM: Carl and Marsha Mueller, the parents of the late Kayla Mueller, are speaking. Carl says al-Baghdadi raped his daughter repeatedly while beating and torturing her.\n\n\u201cWe put all our faith in the government. But our government let us down. President Obama refused to meet with us until ISIS had already beheaded other Americans. To this day, we\u2019ve never heard from Joe Biden. Instead, the Obama administration hid behind policy so much that we felt hopeless when they kept us from negotiating to save Kayla\u2019s life,\u201d Carl Mueller says. \u201cThe administration showed more concern for the terrorists in Guantanamo than for the American hostages in Syria.\u201d\n\nHe says the \u201cmilitary prepared a rescue mission, but the White House delayed it. By the time it went forward, Kayla had been moved to a different location.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a difference a president makes,\u201d he continues.\n\n\u201cThe Trump team gave us empathy we never received from the Obama administration. The Obama administration said it was doing everything it could. The Trump administration is,\u201d he says. \u201cLet me just say this: Kayla should be here. If Donald Trump had been President when Kayla was captured, she would be here today.\u201d\n\n9:46 PM. Sen. Cotton says Obama\u2019s secretary of defense said Biden has gotten almost every foreign policy decision wrong and compares Biden\u2019s foreign policy record to Trump\u2019s:\n\nJoe Biden slashed defense spending again and again. President Trump rebuilt our military\u2014and added the Space Force.\n\nJoe Biden let ISIS terrorists rampage across the Middle East. President Trump eliminated ISIS\u2019s leader\u2014and destroyed its caliphate.\n\nJoe Biden opposed the mission to kill Osama bin Laden. President Trump avenged the murder of hundreds of Americans by killing Iran\u2019s terrorist mastermind, Qassim Soleimani.\n\nJoe Biden sent pallets of cash to the ayatollahs. President Trump ripped up the dangerous Iran nuclear deal.\n\nJoe Biden treated Israel like a nuisance. President Trump moved our embassy to Jerusalem and brokered peace deals in the Middle East.\n\nJoe Biden coddled socialist dictators in Cuba and Venezuela. President Trump fights against communism\u2014in America\u2019s backyard and around the world.\n\nAnd on the Communist Party of China, there is no comparison.\n\nJoe Biden aided and abetted China\u2019s rise for fifty years with terrible trade deals that closed our factories and laid off our workers. President Trump stands up to China\u2019s cheating, and stealing, and lying.\n\nJoe Biden allowed Chinese fentanyl to flood across our southern border. President Trump sanctioned Chinese drug dealers for poisoning our kids.\n\nAfter saying China is rooting for Biden, Cotton says we need a president who stands up for America, not someone like Biden who will take a knee.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton: \u201cWe need a president who stands up for America \u2014 not one to takes a knee.

Too many of our fellow Americans are already honored at the hallowed grounds of Arlington,\u201d Cotton continues. \u201cBut if we want peace, we must be strong. Weakness is provocative. President Trump\u2019s strength has kept us out of war. Joe Biden won\u2019t stand up for America. Donald Trump will. So this November, let\u2019s stand with the president and vote to keep America great.\u201d\n\n9:36 PM: Giuliani says don\u2019t let Democrats do to America what they have done to New York. He says New Yorkers are wondering \u201chow did we get overwhelmed by crime so quickly and decline so fast.\u201d He says this \u201cunprecedented wave of lawlessness began with a truly just cause\u2013 the unforgiveable police killing of George Floyd.\u201d\n\nHe accuses BLM and Antifa of hijacking peaceful protest into vicious and brutal riots because a \u201cunified proposal to reduce police misconduct\u201d would make Trump seem like a leader.\n\nGiuliani talks about the murder of 4-year old LeGen Taliferro in Kansas City, 17-year-old New York basketball Star Brandon Hendricks, who had committed to St. John\u2019s, one-year-old Davell Gardner, Jr., who was shot and killed in a stroller at a cook-out in Brooklyn. He said these murders caused no outrage on the left.\n\n\u201cFor President Trump, and for us Republicans, all Black Lives Matter and the lives of LaGen, Brandon and Davell matter to us,\u201d he says.\n\nHe cites the murders in Chicago and presumes Black lives in Chicago did not matter to Obama-Biden. He says the crime wave will continue if Biden is elected and says this is something that cannot be solved from Biden\u2019s basement.\n\n\u201cThere is no question that this awesome job of restoring safety cannot be done from your basement, Joe,\u201d he says.\n\n9:33 PM: Police Benevolent Association President Pat Lynch of New York says the stakes have never been higher.\n\n\u201cLike cops across this country, we are staring down the barrel of a public safety disaster,\u201d he says.\n\nHe says people in the community ask him every day why so many people are getting murdered. He says \u201cthe answer is simple: The Democrats have walked away from us. Democratic politicians have surrendered our streets and institutions.\u201d\n\nHe says Democrats have passed laws that have made it impossible for police officers to work without their hands tied behind their backs.\n\nThere is nobody who hates bad cops more than good cops, but that doesn\u2019t matter to the radical left. To them, we\u2019re all bad, because we\u2019re all blue. Their anti-law enforcement campaign isn\u2019t about a single incident. It\u2019s about a message. The message is: police officers are the enemy.\n\nThe message is: criminals have the right to resist arrest. The message is: if you victimize a vulnerable person, the justice system will not hold you accountable,\u201d he says. \u201cThe criminals have heard that message, and they are taking full advantage. We must stop that message. We must expose the left\u2019s lies about police officers and the job we do.\u201d\n\nHe says while Democrats are running in fear of the mob in the streets, Trump has never apologized \u201cfor standing up for law and order.\u201d\n\n9:25 PM: Dr. Ben Carson says his heart goes out to the Blake family.\n\nBen Carson: \"Our hearts go out to the Blake family, and the other families who've been impacted by the tragic events in Kenosha.\" Full #RNC2020 video here: https://t.co/ZpNptJvTzQ pic.twitter.com/woWRKI7PlC \u2014 CSPAN (@cspan) August 28, 2020\n\n\u201cIn order to succeed in change, we must first come together in love of our fellow citizens,\u201d Carson says.\n\nHe says Trump believes in the people and is \u201cone of us.\u201d\n\nHe does not submit to political correctness or to its enforcers, the media. He is real.\n\n\u201cRight now, we need real. We need courage. We can\u2019t cower in the corner and hope that no one calls us a name, believing that will keep us safe. That is not courage, and that will not lead us to a good and just place,\u201d Carson says. \u201cWe must remember all those who sacrificed everything in order to give us freedom, and we must be willing to do the same for those who come after us.\u201d\n\nHe says Trump also doesn\u2019t dabble in identity politics and wants everyone to succeed.\n\n\u201cMany on the other side love to incite division by claiming that President Trump is a racist. They could not be more wrong,\u201d Carson says. \u201cYears ago, Jesse Jackson gave Donald Trump an award for the economic opportunities he created for Black people. In Palm Beach, Florida, Donald Trump led the crusade to allow blacks and Jews into private clubs and resorts. One of the first things he did as president was bring the Office of Historically Black Colleges and Universities into the White House so that it could get proper attention and financial support. Before the pandemic, African American unemployment was at an all-time low.\u201d\n\nCarson also touts Trump\u2019s prison reform agenda and support for school choice.\n\nCarson says what \u201cis racist is the fact that African Americans have the highest abortion rate,\u201d and he hails Trump as the most pro-life president.\n\n9;19 PM: Ann Dorn\u2014the widow of the late David Dorn, a retired police officer whom a looter murdered during the George Floyd protests in St Louis\u2013says her husband \u201chad a big smile and a heart to match. He was blessed with the gift of gab, and that gift enabled him to touch souls and inspire people, especially young people.\u201d\n\nHe says after David retired, he still befriended everyone. She talks about a young man named Lee who opened a pawn shop. Whenever the shop\u2019s alarm went off, the alarm company called Dave\u2026She says most of the alarms were false alarms:\n\nThe alarm that went off the morning of June 2nd was for real. It was a violent night in St. Louis. Four police officers were shot. Others were hit with rocks and fireworks. At least 55 businesses were damaged, looted, or set on fire. As the Officer Wellness and CIT Coordinator with the police department, I was keenly aware of the rioting and spent the evening getting ready to mobilize support for officers who were impacted. After I had gone to bed, Dave received a call from Lee\u2019s alarm company. The front door of the pawn shop had been breached. This time, he didn\u2019t wake me up to tell me. He probably knew I would have tried to stop him or insisted on going with him. As I slept, looters were ransacking the shop. They shot and killed Dave in cold blood and then live-streamed the execution and his last moments on this earth. Dave\u2019s grandson was watching the video on Facebook in real time, not realizing he was watching his own grandfather dying on the sidewalk.\n\nShe says she re-lives this horror in her mind every day.\n\n\u201cMy hope is that having you re-live it with me now will help shake this country from this nightmare we\u2019re witnessing in our cities and bring about positive, peaceful change,\u201d she says. \u201cHow did we get to this point where so many young people are so callous and indifferent towards human life? This isn\u2019t a video game where you can commit mayhem and then hit reset and bring all the characters back to life. David is never coming back to me. He was murdered by people who didn\u2019t know, and just didn\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nAnn Dorn says \u201cviolence and destruction are not legitimate forms of protest. They do not safeguard black lives.\u201d She says Trump knows we need more Davids in our communities\u2013not fewer.\n\n9:15 PM: Debbie Flood, who owns a small foundry and machine shop in Wisconsin that manufactures cast bronze architectural hardware, says she lost nearly 50% of her business to China in the mid-2000s. She wondered how a small company like hers could continue to compete.\n\n\u201cAt the time, Joe Biden was a senator,\u201d she says. \u201cHe voted to normalize trade with China and helped pave the way for them to join the WTO, even though they were hurting American companies like ours.\u201d\n\nShe says that when \u201cDonald Trump was elected, and we breathed a sigh of relief.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe actually fought for American workers and American craftsmen,\u201d she says. \u201cHe actually cared about bringing back those three beautiful words, \u2018Made in America.'\u201d\n\nShe says Biden doesn\u2019t know anything about creating jobs or business. She says he has spent 47 years in government and it is doubtful he will figure it out in year 48.\n\n9:10 PM: Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes talks about his Hawaiian, Filipino, Japanese and Spanish ancestry.\n\n\u201cMy father demonstrated his warrior spirit over 50 years ago fighting a dictator in his homeland\u2013the Philippines. Barely escaping with his life, he started anew in America,\u201d he says. \u201cHe arrived with nothing but faith, determination and a willingness to work hard. He lived the American Dream, building businesses, a family and seeing me become Utah\u2019s first minority statewide elected official. Today, I channel my warrior roots by battling human trafficking.\u201d\n\nHe says he has led some of the largest human trafficking prosecutions and \u201cPresident Donald Trump is a fierce warrior against human trafficking.\u201d He says Trump asked insightful questions and \u201cpromised to attack this evil\u201d when they met in 2017.\n\nReyes says he lost his father to cancer a few months ago: \u201cWhen he passed, he had by his bedside: his scriptures, family photos and a pen President Trump gave me to give him. Dad loved that pen. It represented freedom to him, the freedom that only exists when someone is willing to fight for it\u201d\n\n\u201cTo my father, President Trump is that ultimate warrior fighting for our freedom,\u201d he continues. \u201cIf you listen to Democrats, the media, and liberal elite, they will tell you that America\u2019s light doesn\u2019t shine as brightly around the world as it once did. That\u2019s simply not true. The same light that brought my father to America inspires the desperate and downtrodden equally today.\u201d\n\n9:05 PM: UFC\u2019s Dana White touts Trump\u2019s economic accomplishments and rails against people who want to defund the police.

He says Democrats want to defund the police and take away your Second Amendment rights. They want to give free health care to illegal immigrants and offer no protections to the unborn. He says with two more liberal Senators, we can\u2019t undo the damage they will do. He says that is why Democrats spent two weeks not saying anything about what Joe Biden will do before saying the GOP Senate is the \u201cfirewall\u201d against Nancy Pelosi\u2019s agenda.\n\n8:54 PM: Dan Scavino, who has been working for Trump for 30 years, says he never would have imagined he would be working for Trump for three decades.\n\n\u201cAll these years later, there is a part of me that still feels a sense of wonder every day when I consider the journey we have taken together \u2014 and taken with so many of you watching tonight,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause my personal story with Donald Trump, in so many ways, is your story, too. He saw potential in me. A spark. The possibility that I could be more, do more, and achieve more than even I thought was possible. That\u2019s how he views this country, too. We have all just scratched the surface of what we can do together.\u201d\n\nHe says if there is one thing viewers take away from him tonight, \u201cit is this\u2013President Trump is a kind and decent man. I wish you could be at his side with me to see his endless kindness to everyone he meets.\u201d\n\nBiden Campaign commercial airs while Fox cuts coverage from Scavino\u2019s speech pic.twitter.com/8hbN8ieltk \u2014 Acyn Torabi (@Acyn) August 28, 2020\n\nHe says Trump can\u2019t be bought, bullied, or beaten.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump is the first leader who\u2019s been too strong, too tough, and too savvy to be crushed by the status quo establishment and the political media class,\u201d he says before saying what they call \u201cchaos,\u201d Trump calls \u201cchange.\u201d\n\nHe says Trump is a man of the people and points out the RNC featured real Americans \u201cwho are just like us.\u201d\n\n8:51 PM: Stacia Brightmon talks about having been homeless and finding out about from the Texas Workforce Commission about S&B\u2019s Women in Construction Earn-While-You-Learn apprenticeship program. She says President Trump backed \u201cpolicies that made it easy for states and companies to give opportunities to hardworking Americans\u201d like her.\n\nC-SPAN\n\n8:45 PM: Rep. Jeff Van Drew says how he became a Republican says a lot about today\u2019s Democrats. He says Democrats had become less accepting of American traditions and exceptionalism. He says it was not the party he knew and says his first vote in the House was against the San Francisco liberal for House Speaker. He says, with the Squad, Democrats went from being liberal to radical and were no longer about just raising taxes. They were also for open borders.

President Trump\u2019s strength has kept us out of war.\u201d\n\nOther members of Congress, such as Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) and Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), have praised Trump\u2019s foreign policy for resisting war and pursuing peace.\n\nPaul said during the RNC that former Vice President Joe Biden will to continue to \u201cspill our blood and treasure\u201d should he become the 46th president of the United States.\n\nHe said:\n\nI can tell you the president not only felt the pain of these families, but that the president is committed to ending this war. President Trump is the first president in a generation to seek to end war rather than start one. He intends to end the war in Afghanistan. He is bringing our men and women home.\n\n\u201cJoe Biden won\u2019t stand up for America. Donald Trump will. So this November, let\u2019s stand with the president and vote to keep America great,\u201d Cotton said.\n\nSean Moran is a congressional reporter for Breitbart News.

Kelly was examined by a doctor, who concluded that the singer did not sustain any broken bones or serious injuries.\n\nR. Kelly was charged with racketeering conspiracy in U.S. District Court in New York, which alleged that he identified underage girls attending his concerts and groomed them for sexual abuse. The Grammy-winner has been held without bond since last July.\n\nLast year, R. Kelly pleaded not guilty to federal charges that he sexually abused women and girls who attended his concerts. The 52-year-old singer was denied bail in a New York City courtroom packed with his supporters. In April, a federal judge denied R. Kelly\u2019s request to be release from jail due to fears concerning the Chinese coronavirus outbreak.\n\nYou can follow Alana Mastrangelo on Twitter at @ARmastrangelo, on Parler at @alana, and on Instagram.", "link": "https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2020/08/27/r-kelly-attacked-by-inmate-in-chicago-prison/#disqus_thread", "published": "2020-08-27T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Hollywood Holds Hate Parade During Trump Republican Nomination Speech: \u2018Murderer,\u2019 \u2018Bulls**t Propaganda\u2019", "text": "The left-wing Hollywood celebrities were fuming as President Donald Trump accepted his party\u2019s nomination on the final day of the Republican National Convention.

Ives stated: \u201cWhen you think right now about going up against the 800-pound gorilla, Amazon, obviously they\u2019ve been behind the eight ball. But Walmart could use this as a golden opportunity to partner with Microsoft and monetize the TikTok base, which could start to rival Instagram in the next few years just given its global presence.\n\nIves gave the bid an 85 to 90 percent chance of going through.\n\nRead more at CNBC here.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

Upon being abducted and identified as a Westerner, ISIS jihadists placed Kayla into slavery. She became the property of Abu Sayyaf and wife Umm Sayyaf (\u201cUmm\u201d a common pseudonym for women jihadists meaning \u201cmother\u201d), where the \u201ccaliph\u201d of the terrorist group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, raped and tortured her.\n\nA U.S. military raid in October resulted in al-Baghdadi\u2019s death. Cornered by a military canine, al-Baghdadi detonated a suicide bomb, killing himself and three of his children.\n\n\u201cHe died like a dog, he died like a coward,\u201d President Donald Trump said at the time. \u201cThe world is now a much safer place.\u201d\n\nThe mission to capture al-Baghdadi was named after Kayla.\n\nKayla Mueller is believed to have died in Raqqa, Syria \u2013 the \u201ccapital\u201d of the Islamic State caliphate \u2013 in February 2015. ISIS terrorists claimed that a Jordanian airstrike targeting al-Baghdadi killed her, but have never presented any evidence corroborating that claim.\n\nThe Muellers recalled their daughter as \u201camazing,\u201d with \u201ca gift to be able to see the world through someone else\u2019s eyes.\u201d Marsha Mueller noted that Kayla\u2019s existence was a sort of miracle, as doctors had told the couple they likely could not have conceived her.\n\nThey noted that her gift of empathy took her to Syria, where she was abducted and, they said, largely ignored by the incumbent Obama administration.\n\n\u201cKayla was mostly held in a 12\u2019 by 12\u2019 cell in solitary confinement. It was cold and dirty. ISIS terrorists shined bright lights in her face. They shaved her head. They beat her and tortured her,\u201d father Carl Mueller detailed. \u201cThe leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, raped her repeatedly. For 18 months, she endured. And we endured an agonizing back-and-forth between us, the Obama administration, and ISIS.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe put all our faith in the government. But our government let us down,\u201d Carl Mueller lamented.\n\nCarl Mueller then accused the Obama White House of delaying a mission that could have rescued his daughter and placing very little importance on the case.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama refused to meet with us until ISIS had already beheaded other Americans. To this day, we\u2019ve never heard from Joe Biden,\u201d Carl Mueller said. \u201cInstead, the Obama administration hid behind policy so much that we felt hopeless when they kept us from negotiating to save Kayla\u2019s life.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe administration showed more concern for the terrorists in Guantanamo than for the American hostages in Syria,\u201d Carl noted pointedly. \u201cThe Obama administration kept telling us they were doing everything they could. But their version of \u2018everything\u2019 wasn\u2019t enough. What a difference a president makes.\u201d\n\nBoth Muellers wholeheartedly endorsed Trump.\n\n\u201cThe Trump team gave us empathy we never received from the Obama administration. The Obama administration said it was doing everything it could. The Trump administration actually is,\u201d Carl Mueller said.\n\n\u201cLet me just say this: Kayla should be here. If Donald Trump had been President when Kayla was captured, she would be here today,\u201d Carl affirmed.\n\n\u201cCarl and I support Donald Trump because of his commitment to make and keep America great, not with the power of the government, but with the passion of people like Kayla \u2014 Americans who, even in the darkest days, always have more fight left inside of them,\u201d Marsha Mueller said. \u201cAmericans who don\u2019t just talk \u2014 they act. That was our daughter. That\u2019s President Trump. As long as we stay strong like Kayla, as long as we refuse to break, we will be great.\u201d\n\nMarsha Mueller, while her husband held up a photo of Kayla, read a letter retrieved after her death from Syria that Kayla had written in captivity, highlighting the intensity of her faith.\n\n\u201cI have been shown in darkness, light and have learned that even in prison, one can be free. I am grateful \u2026 I have had many hours to think how only in your absence have I finally at 25 years old come to realize your place in my life,\u201d Kayla wrote. \u201cNone of us could have known it would be this long but know I am also fighting from my side in the ways I am able and I have a lot of fight left inside of me \u2026 I am not breaking down and I will not give in no matter how long it takes.\u201d\n\nKayla Mueller was held for a time by Islamic State financier Abu Sayyaf and his wife Umm Sayyaf. Abu Sayyaf was killed in a 2015 raid, while Umm Sayyaf (real name Nasrin As\u2019ad Ibrahim) was taken alive and charged by the FBI with imprisoning and torturing Mueller. According to the FBI affidavit, Mueller was personally raped by al-Baghdadi, who referred to her as his \u201cwife,\u201d while in the Sayyafs\u2019 custody. Witnesses who knew Mueller in her captivity say she endured being al-Baghdadi\u2019s sex slave as well as other torture, such as having her fingernails ripped out, in an attempt to get her to convert to Islam. Witnesses have affirmed her refusal to renounce her Christian faith.\n\nBoth Umm Sayyaf, captured by Kurdish fighters in 2015, and escaped ISIS sex slaves spoke highly of Kayla in custody, describing her as resolute and concerned about the wellbeing of the other women in captivity. Islamic State terrorists regularly abducted girls and women throughout Iraq and Syria to use in sex slavery, particularly non-Arab Muslim girls from Christian and Yazidi communities.\n\n\u201cShe was a lovely girl and I liked her. She was very respectful and I respected her.

Upon being abducted and identified as a Westerner, ISIS jihadists placed Kayla into slavery. She became the property of Abu Sayyaf and wife Umm Sayyaf (\u201cUmm\u201d a common pseudonym for women jihadists meaning \u201cmother\u201d), where the \u201ccaliph\u201d of the terrorist group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, raped and tortured her.\n\nA U.S. military raid in October resulted in al-Baghdadi\u2019s death. Cornered by a military canine, al-Baghdadi detonated a suicide bomb, killing himself and three of his children.\n\n\u201cHe died like a dog, he died like a coward,\u201d President Donald Trump said at the time. \u201cThe world is now a much safer place.\u201d\n\nThe mission to capture al-Baghdadi was named after Kayla.\n\nKayla Mueller is believed to have died in Raqqa, Syria \u2013 the \u201ccapital\u201d of the Islamic State caliphate \u2013 in February 2015. ISIS terrorists claimed that a Jordanian airstrike targeting al-Baghdadi killed her, but have never presented any evidence corroborating that claim.\n\nThe Muellers recalled their daughter as \u201camazing,\u201d with \u201ca gift to be able to see the world through someone else\u2019s eyes.\u201d Marsha Mueller noted that Kayla\u2019s existence was a sort of miracle, as doctors had told the couple they likely could not have conceived her.\n\nThey noted that her gift of empathy took her to Syria, where she was abducted and, they said, largely ignored by the incumbent Obama administration.\n\n\u201cKayla was mostly held in a 12\u2019 by 12\u2019 cell in solitary confinement. It was cold and dirty. ISIS terrorists shined bright lights in her face. They shaved her head. They beat her and tortured her,\u201d father Carl Mueller detailed. \u201cThe leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, raped her repeatedly. For 18 months, she endured. And we endured an agonizing back-and-forth between us, the Obama administration, and ISIS.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe put all our faith in the government. But our government let us down,\u201d Carl Mueller lamented.\n\nCarl Mueller then accused the Obama White House of delaying a mission that could have rescued his daughter and placing very little importance on the case.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama refused to meet with us until ISIS had already beheaded other Americans. To this day, we\u2019ve never heard from Joe Biden,\u201d Carl Mueller said. \u201cInstead, the Obama administration hid behind policy so much that we felt hopeless when they kept us from negotiating to save Kayla\u2019s life.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe administration showed more concern for the terrorists in Guantanamo than for the American hostages in Syria,\u201d Carl noted pointedly. \u201cThe Obama administration kept telling us they were doing everything they could. But their version of \u2018everything\u2019 wasn\u2019t enough. What a difference a president makes.\u201d\n\nBoth Muellers wholeheartedly endorsed Trump.\n\n\u201cThe Trump team gave us empathy we never received from the Obama administration. The Obama administration said it was doing everything it could. The Trump administration actually is,\u201d Carl Mueller said.\n\n\u201cLet me just say this: Kayla should be here. If Donald Trump had been President when Kayla was captured, she would be here today,\u201d Carl affirmed.\n\n\u201cCarl and I support Donald Trump because of his commitment to make and keep America great, not with the power of the government, but with the passion of people like Kayla \u2014 Americans who, even in the darkest days, always have more fight left inside of them,\u201d Marsha Mueller said. \u201cAmericans who don\u2019t just talk \u2014 they act. That was our daughter. That\u2019s President Trump. As long as we stay strong like Kayla, as long as we refuse to break, we will be great.\u201d\n\nMarsha Mueller, while her husband held up a photo of Kayla, read a letter retrieved after her death from Syria that Kayla had written in captivity, highlighting the intensity of her faith.\n\n\u201cI have been shown in darkness, light and have learned that even in prison, one can be free. I am grateful \u2026 I have had many hours to think how only in your absence have I finally at 25 years old come to realize your place in my life,\u201d Kayla wrote. \u201cNone of us could have known it would be this long but know I am also fighting from my side in the ways I am able and I have a lot of fight left inside of me \u2026 I am not breaking down and I will not give in no matter how long it takes.\u201d\n\nKayla Mueller was held for a time by Islamic State financier Abu Sayyaf and his wife Umm Sayyaf. Abu Sayyaf was killed in a 2015 raid, while Umm Sayyaf (real name Nasrin As\u2019ad Ibrahim) was taken alive and charged by the FBI with imprisoning and torturing Mueller. According to the FBI affidavit, Mueller was personally raped by al-Baghdadi, who referred to her as his \u201cwife,\u201d while in the Sayyafs\u2019 custody. Witnesses who knew Mueller in her captivity say she endured being al-Baghdadi\u2019s sex slave as well as other torture, such as having her fingernails ripped out, in an attempt to get her to convert to Islam. Witnesses have affirmed her refusal to renounce her Christian faith.\n\nBoth Umm Sayyaf, captured by Kurdish fighters in 2015, and escaped ISIS sex slaves spoke highly of Kayla in custody, describing her as resolute and concerned about the wellbeing of the other women in captivity. Islamic State terrorists regularly abducted girls and women throughout Iraq and Syria to use in sex slavery, particularly non-Arab Muslim girls from Christian and Yazidi communities.\n\n\u201cShe was a lovely girl and I liked her. She was very respectful and I respected her. One thing I would say is she was very good at hiding her sadness and pain,\u201d Umm Sayyaf said in June 2019.\n\nA teen Yazidi girl who endured sex slavery and knew Kayla Mueller in captivity said in 2015 that, when she and other Yazidis escaped, they tried to convince Mueller to flee with them, but she said that, as she was clearing an American white woman, she would be conspicuous and endanger their escape, so she stayed.\n\nUnder the Trump administration, a combined effort between the U.S. military and the largely Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) brought down ISIS is Raqqa, its capital, ending the physical \u201ccaliphate\u201d in 2017.

One professor went so far as to label Trump as the school\u2019s \u201cworst admissions mistake.\u201d In a recent book, Trump\u2019s niece made the claim that the president hired an expert to take his SAT exam in his place. This week, the university rejected calls to investigate the president\u2019s college entrance exam, citing the impracticality of the task.\n\nAccording to a student newspaper report, professors at the University of Pennsylvania are demanding an investigation into the claim that President Donald Trump cheated on the SAT college entrance exam in 1963. The president\u2019s niece, Mary Trump, claimed in her recent book that the president hired an expert to take his SAT exam prior to his admission to Penn\u2019s Wharton School in the 1960s.\n\n\u201cConcerns about cheating are exacerbated when the alleged perpetrator is a public figure in high office,\u201d the professors wrote. \u201cFailing to investigate an allegation of fraud at such a level broadcasts to prospective students and the world at large that the playing field is not equal, that our degrees can be bought, and that subsequent fame, wealth, and political status will excuse past misconduct.\u201d\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania business professor Eric Orts argues that admitting President Trump to the university was the \u201cworst admissions mistake\u201d the school has made.

A barrier of border agents, regulatory changes, and the steel-and-concrete wall have sharply dropped the cross-border flow of migrants, despite the massive economic pressure caused by the distant promise of decent jobs in the United States.\n\nIn his acceptance speech at the RNC, Trump declared:\n\nToday, America\u2019s borders are more secure than ever before. We ended catch-and-release, stopped asylum fraud, took down human traffickers who prey on women and children, and we have deported 20,000 gang members and 500,000 criminal aliens. We have already built 300 miles of border wall \u2014 and we are adding ten new miles every single week. The wall will soon be complete, and it is working beyond our wildest expectations.\n\nThe data is displayed by the Department of Homeland Security and show that the number of migrants at the border has been pushed down from 144,000 in May 2019 to 23,000 in 2020.\n\nThe reduced inflow of migrants has helped border officers block more drug trafficking.

A barrier of border agents, regulatory changes, and the steel-and-concrete wall have sharply dropped the cross-border flow of migrants, despite the massive economic pressure caused by the distant promise of decent jobs in the United States.\n\nIn his acceptance speech at the RNC, Trump declared:\n\nToday, America\u2019s borders are more secure than ever before. We ended catch-and-release, stopped asylum fraud, took down human traffickers who prey on women and children, and we have deported 20,000 gang members and 500,000 criminal aliens. We have already built 300 miles of border wall \u2014 and we are adding ten new miles every single week. The wall will soon be complete, and it is working beyond our wildest expectations.\n\nThe data is displayed by the Department of Homeland Security and show that the number of migrants at the border has been pushed down from 144,000 in May 2019 to 23,000 in 2020.\n\nThe reduced inflow of migrants has helped border officers block more drug trafficking.

We already started talking about that. We tried to get it done. I think it can be done. And it should be demanded that we do it. And that\u2019s a good expenditure of money.\u201d [Emphasis added]\n\nRealClearPolitics reported a CNN interview with Biden in which Anderson Cooper asked him about gun owners who were afraid a Biden administration would take away their guns:\n\nCNN: So, to gun owners out there who say, well, a Biden administration means they\u2019re going to come for my guns? BIDEN: Bingo. You\u2019re right if you have an assault weapon. The fact of the matter is, they should be illegal, period. Look, the Second Amendment doesn\u2019t say you can\u2019t restrict the kinds of weapons people can own. You can\u2019t buy a bazooka. You can\u2019t have a flame thrower.\n\nIn early September 2019, Breitbart News reported Harris\u2019s support for government-mandated buybacks of AR-15 rifles. On September 6, 2019, Bloomberg reported that Harris had not worked out all the details on how the buyback would work, yet she said, \u201cI think it\u2019s a good idea.\u201d\n\nHer support of a mandatory buyback came weeks after then-presidential hopeful Robert \u201cBeto\u201d O\u2019Rourke pushed for \u201ca mandatory buyback of every assault weapon in our country.\u201d\n\nA government-mandated buyback is not a voluntary buyback, but a government-enforced buyback. It is the kind of buyback VOX reports that Australia implemented over the course of 1996-1997.\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have both voiced support for a government-mandated buyback of AR-15s and other commonly-owned semiautomatic rifles.\n\nTrump said, \u201cIf the left gains power, they will demolish the suburbs, confiscate your guns, and appoint justices who will wipe away your Second Amendment and other Constitutional freedoms.\u201d\n\nHis claim that they \u201cwill confiscate your guns\u201d is born out by statements both Biden and Harris made during the campaigns they ran in hopes of winning the Democrat presidential primary cycle.\n\nOn August 7, 2019, Breitbart News reported that Biden voiced support for mandatory buybacks of AR-15s and other commonly-owned semiautomatic rifles during the first Democrat debate of the primary cycle.\n\nBiden said, \u201cFolks, look, and I would buy back [assault] weapons. We already started talking about that. We tried to get it done. I think it can be done. And it should be demanded that we do it. And that\u2019s a good expenditure of money.\u201d [Emphasis added]\n\nRealClearPolitics reported a CNN interview with Biden in which Anderson Cooper asked him about gun owners who were afraid a Biden administration would take away their guns:\n\nCNN: So, to gun owners out there who say, well, a Biden administration means they\u2019re going to come for my guns? BIDEN: Bingo. You\u2019re right if you have an assault weapon. The fact of the matter is, they should be illegal, period. Look, the Second Amendment doesn\u2019t say you can\u2019t restrict the kinds of weapons people can own. You can\u2019t buy a bazooka. You can\u2019t have a flame thrower.\n\nIn early September 2019, Breitbart News reported Harris\u2019s support for government-mandated buybacks of AR-15 rifles. On September 6, 2019, Bloomberg reported that Harris had not worked out all the details on how the buyback would work, yet she said, \u201cI think it\u2019s a good idea.\u201d\n\nHer support of a mandatory buyback came weeks after then-presidential hopeful Robert \u201cBeto\u201d O\u2019Rourke pushed for \u201ca mandatory buyback of every assault weapon in our country.\u201d\n\nA government-mandated buyback is not a voluntary buyback, but a government-enforced buyback. It is the kind of buyback VOX reports that Australia implemented over the course of 1996-1997.\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins, a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

It made me feel like we are on the right path of change.\u201d\n\nThe 42-second moment of silence came a day before Major League Baseball plans to hold its annual Jackie Robinson Day, which was pushed back from the usual April 15 due to the pandemic.\n\n\u201cIt needs to be an ongoing thing,\u201d Brinson said. \u201cIt can\u2019t just be one day out of the baseball year that we bring light to everything.\u201d\n\nThe teams walked off about two hours after a video appeared on the league\u2019s official website in which Mets general manager Brodie Van Wagenen said that his players did not want to play and they were waiting to hear from the Marlins about coordinating a postponement.\n\nVan Wagenen also criticized Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred\u2019s handling of player protests this week and alleged Manfred was pressuring New York to stage a symbolic walkout against players\u2019 wishes, rather than a full postponement.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Rob\u2019s instinct,\u201d Van Wagenen said in a conversation he didn\u2019t appear to know was being streamed on MLB.com. \u201cAt a leadership level, he doesn\u2019t get it. He just doesn\u2019t get it.\u201d\n\nVan Wagenen said in the video \u2014 after specifying the conversation \u201ccan\u2019t leave this room\u201d \u2014 that Manfred wanted the Mets and Marlins to walk off the field together shortly before the scheduled 7:10 p.m. first pitch, then come back and play at 8:10 p.m.\n\nVan Wagenen apologized for his comments later Thursday, saying in a statement the idea to walk out and return was actually hatched by Mets Chief Operating Officer Jeff Wilpon.\n\n\u201cI have put myself and this organization into this conversation in a way that takes away from the real point,\u201d Van Wagenen said on a conference call Thursday night. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed in myself.\u201d\n\nManfred said in a statement that he has not tried to override players\u2019 wishes to protest by not playing.\n\n\u201cOver the past two days, players on a number of Clubs have decided not to play games,\u201d he said. \u201cI have said both publicly and privately that I respect those decisions and support the need to address social injustice. I have not attempted in any way to prevent players from expressing themselves by not playing, nor have I suggested any alternative form of protest to any Club personnel or any player. Any suggestion to the contrary is wrong.\u201d\n\nVan Wagenen said he didn\u2019t know how or when the Mets and Marlins, who were scheduled to complete their season series Thursday, would make up the game. The only mutual day off remaining for both teams is Monday.", "link": "https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2020/08/27/watch-mets-marlins-observe-moment-silence-walk-off-field-leave-blm-shirt/#disqus_thread", "published": "2020-08-27T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Dana White: America Needs \u2018Trump\u2019s Leadership Now More than Ever\u2019", "text": "Dana White, the president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), took part in the fourth and final night of the Republican National Convention where he reiterated his support for President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cMany of you know who I am, what I do, and that I am friends with the president,\u201d White said. \u201cI spoke at this convention four years ago, and I am back because I believe we need President Trump\u2019s leadership now more than ever.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore the pandemic, President Trump built the greatest economy in our nation\u2019s history and created opportunities for all Americans like no one before him,\u201d White continued. \u201cFinancial markets hit all-time highs, unemployment was at an all-time low, and we weren\u2019t facing the lawless destruction that is now occurring in a few of our great cities.\u201d\n\nWhite also noted how law enforcement officials have been mistreated and \u201cforgotten\u201d by the Democrat Party and several of those who are protesting in the streets.\n\n\u201cIt blows my mind how quickly some of the leadership in this country has forgotten the critical role first responders play in our society,\u201d White stated. \u201cPolice departments and other law enforcement \u2014 even some fire departments \u2014 have faced opposition from many in this country.

Biden again claimed falsely that President Trump had referred to neo-Nazis and white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, as \u201cvery fine people.\u201d This is a lie that has been debunked repeatedly \u2014 and yet Biden persists with it, even though he has been challenged directly about the fact that he is misquoting Trump, who said the neo-Nazis and white supremacists should be \u201ccondemned totally.\u201d The \u201cvery fine people\u201d were non-violent protesters on either side of the issue of the removal of a statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee from a local park, not the extremists.\n\nBiden claimed that President Trump is doing \u201cnothing\u201d about coronavirus. This is a nonsense claim. Biden could have criticized specific things Trump has done, but the idea that he has done \u201cnothing\u201d is ludicrous. From the China travel ban \u2014 which Biden opposed; to the coronavirus task force; to the CARES Act; to the Payment Protection Program; to Operation Warp Speed on vaccines (see below); to invoking the Defense Production Act to manufacture much-needed ventilators and personal protective equipment; to the mobilization of military hospitals and ships; Trump has done plenty of things.\n\nBiden claimed the Republican National Convention (RNC) \u201cdidn\u2019t speak about COVID.\u201d Several speakers at the RNC spoke about the coronavirus, or COVID-19, and the president specifically honored medical professionals on the front lines. First Lady Melania Trump shared the grief of those families who have lost loved ones to the disease, as did Vice President Mike Pence. Biden\u2019s statement is utterly indefensible and suggests he did not watch the RNC, but had it summarized for him.\n\nBiden claimed that Trump talked about \u201cinjecting bleach.\u201d Trump never said that. He talked about injecting ultraviolet (UV) light, a long-used disinfectant, into the lungs as an experimental therapy. When a journalist asked whether he meant to encourage injecting bleach, Trump specifically said no. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be through injection. We\u2019re talking about through almost a cleaning, sterilization of an area.\u201d Trump\u2019s remarks were widely misconstrued, and Biden continues to misquote him.\n\nBiden claimed that the Trump administration had no plan for distributing a vaccine for coronavirus. The plan is called Operation Warp Speed, and the president talks about it frequently. The goal of the plan is to distribute 300 million doses of vaccine to the entire country \u2014 something Biden specifically claimed Trump had no plan to do. The plans and documents are available on the website of the Department of Health and Human Services, and have been available there for months.\n\nBiden claimed that there were no race riots during the Obama-Biden administration and the National Guard was never called. He seemed to have forgotten that the Black Lives Matter movement started in 2014, and rioted in Ferguson, Missouri; or that the National Guard were called in to quell race riots in Baltimore, Maryland after the death of Freddie Gray in police custody in 2015; or that five police were murdered in Dallas, Texas, during a Black Lives Matter march in 2016.\n\nBiden claimed that Kellyanne Conway said Republicans were encouraging violence because it helped them politically. Her exact quote was: \u201cThe more chaos and anarchy and vandalism and violence reigns, the better it is for the very clear choice on who\u2019s best on public safety and law and order.\u201d Biden omitted the context, in which Conway had pointed out that Democrat mayors and governors had refused President Trump\u2019s offers to send help to stop the violence and the looting.\n\n\u201cJacob Blake was never mentioned in any of the speeches at the Republican convention.\u201d This last lie was told by Mitchell herself. The opening speech of the second night of the RNC referred to Blake specifically. Pastor Norma Urrabazo offered an opening prayer in which she said: \u201cLord, we come before you to ask for your spirit of peace to come over hurting communities in Wisconsin tonight.

Biden again claimed falsely that President Trump had referred to neo-Nazis and white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia, as \u201cvery fine people.\u201d This is a lie that has been debunked repeatedly \u2014 and yet Biden persists with it, even though he has been challenged directly about the fact that he is misquoting Trump, who said the neo-Nazis and white supremacists should be \u201ccondemned totally.\u201d The \u201cvery fine people\u201d were non-violent protesters on either side of the issue of the removal of a statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee from a local park, not the extremists.\n\nBiden claimed that President Trump is doing \u201cnothing\u201d about coronavirus. This is a nonsense claim. Biden could have criticized specific things Trump has done, but the idea that he has done \u201cnothing\u201d is ludicrous. From the China travel ban \u2014 which Biden opposed; to the coronavirus task force; to the CARES Act; to the Payment Protection Program; to Operation Warp Speed on vaccines (see below); to invoking the Defense Production Act to manufacture much-needed ventilators and personal protective equipment; to the mobilization of military hospitals and ships; Trump has done plenty of things.\n\nBiden claimed the Republican National Convention (RNC) \u201cdidn\u2019t speak about COVID.\u201d Several speakers at the RNC spoke about the coronavirus, or COVID-19, and the president specifically honored medical professionals on the front lines. First Lady Melania Trump shared the grief of those families who have lost loved ones to the disease, as did Vice President Mike Pence. Biden\u2019s statement is utterly indefensible and suggests he did not watch the RNC, but had it summarized for him.\n\nBiden claimed that Trump talked about \u201cinjecting bleach.\u201d Trump never said that. He talked about injecting ultraviolet (UV) light, a long-used disinfectant, into the lungs as an experimental therapy. When a journalist asked whether he meant to encourage injecting bleach, Trump specifically said no. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be through injection. We\u2019re talking about through almost a cleaning, sterilization of an area.\u201d Trump\u2019s remarks were widely misconstrued, and Biden continues to misquote him.\n\nBiden claimed that the Trump administration had no plan for distributing a vaccine for coronavirus. The plan is called Operation Warp Speed, and the president talks about it frequently. The goal of the plan is to distribute 300 million doses of vaccine to the entire country \u2014 something Biden specifically claimed Trump had no plan to do. The plans and documents are available on the website of the Department of Health and Human Services, and have been available there for months.\n\nBiden claimed that there were no race riots during the Obama-Biden administration and the National Guard was never called. He seemed to have forgotten that the Black Lives Matter movement started in 2014, and rioted in Ferguson, Missouri; or that the National Guard were called in to quell race riots in Baltimore, Maryland after the death of Freddie Gray in police custody in 2015; or that five police were murdered in Dallas, Texas, during a Black Lives Matter march in 2016.\n\nBiden claimed that Kellyanne Conway said Republicans were encouraging violence because it helped them politically. Her exact quote was: \u201cThe more chaos and anarchy and vandalism and violence reigns, the better it is for the very clear choice on who\u2019s best on public safety and law and order.\u201d Biden omitted the context, in which Conway had pointed out that Democrat mayors and governors had refused President Trump\u2019s offers to send help to stop the violence and the looting.\n\n\u201cJacob Blake was never mentioned in any of the speeches at the Republican convention.\u201d This last lie was told by Mitchell herself. The opening speech of the second night of the RNC referred to Blake specifically. Pastor Norma Urrabazo offered an opening prayer in which she said: \u201cLord, we come before you to ask for your spirit of peace to come over hurting communities in Wisconsin tonight. We pray for healing and comfort to Jacob Blake and his family. We pray for your protection over those who put their lives in harm\u2019s way to bring safety and security to our streets.\u201d Mitchell was wrong.\n\nJoel B.

The California lawmaker, in particular, argued recent events, including Blake\u2019s shooting and the death of George Floyd in police custody, had exposed the difficult realities facing many of the country\u2019s citizens.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that the life of a black person in America has never been treated as fully human,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe have yet to fulfill that promise of equal justice under the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder people are taking to the streets. And I support them,\u201d she added in another part of the speech. \u201cWe must always defend peaceful protests and peaceful protestors. We should not confuse them with those looting and committing acts of violence, including the shooter who was arrested for murder.\u201d\n\nHarris\u2019s speech came as protests and rioting have continued to roil portions of Wisconsin. The tumult began on Sunday in Kenosha, Wisconsin, when local police shot Blake, a 29-year-old black American man, several times in the back. According to local media reports, police were called to respond to a \u201cdomestic incident\u201d at the site of the shooting. Several witnesses have claimed that Blake was attempting to break up a fight between two women when police arrived.\n\nVideo from the scene, which went viral on social media, shows Blake walking away from police as the officers have their weapons drawn. In the video, Blake is seen opening the door of an SUV as a police officer attempts to stop him before firing at least seven shots into his back.\n\nAfter the video of the shooting appeared on social media, protests erupted on the streets of Kenosha. Those protests quickly turned violent. On Monday, in particular, several businesses were burnt to the ground, including, a local charity.\n\nThe situation only intensified on Tuesday with more looting and confrontations occurring across Kenosha. One of those incidents caught national attention when a 17-year-old Illinois resident, Kyle Rittenhouse, killed two individuals and wounded a third with a rifle. Rittenhouse, who had identified himself as a supporter of law enforcement, was arrested on Wednesday for the shootings.\n\nIn the wake of such incidents, the Department of Justice announced it is deploying federal resources to Wisconsin to help quell the unrest.", "link": "https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/08/27/kamala-harris-the-life-of-a-black-person-in-america-has-never-been-treated-as-fully-human/", "published": "2020-08-27T00:00:00"}, {"title": "***Live Updates*** Republican National Convention Night Three", "text": "The Republican National Convention continues on Wednesday, and Vice President Mike Pence is tonight\u2019s headliner.

Donald Trump has placed in me, the support of our Republican Party, and the grace of God, I humbly accept your nomination to run and serve as Vice President.\" https://t.co/Bu1ofYBbLe #RNC2020 pic.twitter.com/Cg7hrmbGte \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) August 27, 2020\n\nHe says Trump sees America as a nation that has done more good than any other and a nation that deserves far more gratitude than grievance.\n\nPence talks up Trump\u2019s military accomplishments, including the Space Force and reforming the VA.\n\nHe now there are four recipients of the Medal of Honor, six recipients of the Purple Heart, and a Gold Star mother along with Wounded Warriors in the audience. Pence rips Biden for criticizing Trump for ridding the world of two terrorists. He says it\u2019s no surprise because Biden even opposed the mission to hunt down Osama bin Laden. He says no wonder a Secretary of Defense said Biden has been wrong on nearly every national security issue for the last four decades.\n\nPence now talking about moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and the Israel-UAE peace deal before talking about the conservative judges Trump appointed.\n\nOn the economy, Pence says Trump \u201ckept his word and then some.\u201d Tax cuts. Rolling back red tape. Unleashing American energy and fighting for free and fair trade.\n\nPence says America became a net exporter of energy for the first time in 70 years while unemployment rates for African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans hit record lows.\n\nAnd then, he says, the Coronavirus struck from China. Pence says before the first case spread, Trump suspended travel from China and that saved American lives and \u201cbought us invaluable time\u201d to combat the Coronavirus.\n\nPence says nobody who needed a ventilator was denied one and talks up the administration\u2019s economic recovery plan.\n\nHe says Biden said that \u201cno miracle is coming,\u201d but Biden doesn\u2019t understand that \u201cAmerica is a nation of miracles.\u201d He says America is on track to have a Coronavirus vaccine by the end of this year.\n\nPence says we\u2019re not just opening up America again but we\u2019re also opening up America\u2019s schools. He says his wife Karen is returning to her classroom next week. He thanks teachers for being there for the kids.\n\nPence asks voters as we open the country back up to ask themselves: \u201cOn November 3rd, ask yourself: Who do you trust to rebuild this economy? A career politician who presided over the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression? Or a proven leader who created the greatest economy in the world?\u201d\n\nHe says we need four more years of Trump in the White House to bring America back.\n\nPence says he and Trump will always support peaceful protests but rioting and looting are not peaceful protests and tearing down statues is not free speech. He says Biden didn\u2019t say one word last week about the violence and chaos engulfing the cities. Pence says he wants to be clear: \u201cThe violence must stop.\u201d\n\nPence says we will have law and order on the streets of America for Americans of every race, creed, and color.\n\nPence says the he and Trump know that \u201cthe men and women that put on the uniform of law enforcement are the best of us.\u201d\n\nPence says the American people know that you do not have to choose between supporting law enforcement and African-Americans. He says the Trump administration has done both since day one.\n\nPence says Biden thinks America is systemically racist and law enforcement has an implicit bias against people of color, and he will double down on the policies that are causing violence all over America.\n\n\u201cThe hard truth is you won\u2019t be safe in Joe Biden\u2019s America,\u201d he says before saying the Trump administration will always stand with the thin blue line and will never defund the the police\u2013not now, not ever.\n\nVice President Pence: Under President Trump, we will stand with those who stand on the Thin Blue Line, and we\u2019re not going to defund the police\u2014not now, not ever.#RNC2020 pic.twitter.com/NU0Og0fvVA \u2014 Team Trump (Text VOTE to 88022) (@TeamTrump) August 27, 2020\n\nPence asks what Biden is a transition to\u2013he says Democrats didn\u2019t talk much about agenda and he doesn\u2019t blame them. Pence notes that Bernie Sanders said that many of the ideas he fought for are now mainstream. He says at the root of their agenda is that America is driven by envy and the federal government must be involved in every aspect of our lives to \u201ccorrect America\u2019s wrongs.\u201d\n\n\u201cTheir agenda is based on government control,\u201d Pence says. \u201cOurs is based on freedom.\u201d\n\nPence rips Biden for wanting to give free health care and lawyers to illegal immigrants.\n\nPence says Biden supports taxpayer-funded abortion right up to birth, and Biden will be a \u201cTrojan Horse\u201d for the radical left.\n\nPence says this election is not so much whether America will be more conservative or liberal. He says the choice is whether America remains America, whether we live to our children and grandchildren a country grounded in our highest ideals\u2026 or whether we will leave a country that has fundamentally transformed into something else. He says the election is between \u201cfreedom and opportunity\u201d and \u201csocialism and decline.\u201d\n\nPence closes by talking about the toughness that runs in our national character that invading forces learned on approach to this fort on September 1814. Against fierce and sustained bombardment, our young country was defended by heroes, not so different from those with us tonight. The enemy was counting on them to quit. But they never did. Fort McHenry held. And when morning came our flag was still here.\n\nMy fellow Americans, we are going through a time of testing. But if you look through the fog of these challenging times, you will see our flag is still there.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom these hallowed grounds, American patriots in generations gone by did their part to defend freedom. Now it\u2019s our turn.\n\nSo let\u2019s run the race marked out for us. Let\u2019s fix our eyes on Old Glory and all she represents, fix our eyes on this land of heroes and let their courage inspire, let\u2019s fix our eyes on the author and perfector of our faith and freedom, and never forget that \u2018where the spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.\u2019 That means freedom always wins,\u201d Pence says.\n\nTrump joins him on stage as the Trace Adkins performs the National Anthem.\n\nHe says he leaves inspired and more convinced that Americans will re-elect Trump so they can \u201cmake America great again, again.\u201d\n\n10:19 PM: Ric Grenell said during the presidential debates four years ago only one candidate (Trump) said what everyone was thinking inside re: American foreign policy.\n\n\u201cHe called America\u2019s endless wars what they were: A disaster,\u201d he says. \u201cThe media was shocked, because Donald Trump was running as a Republican. And yet he said out loud what we all knew. That American foreign policy was failing to make Americans safer.\u201d\n\nGrenell says that \u201cafter the end of the Cold War, Democrats and Republicans in Washington bought into the illusion that the whole world would start to resemble America. And so they started to pursue unlimited globalization.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey welcomed China into the World Trade Organization. They engaged in nation-building in Afghanistan, and tried to export democracy to Iraq. They signed a nuclear deal with Iran, and a global climate agreement in Paris,\u201d he says. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t ground any of it in the interests of the average American. So for decades, while Washington politicians built a global system, American wages stagnated. Our great cities and industries were hollowed out. Entire communities were devastated, and our manufacturing plants were shipped off to China. That\u2019s what happened when Washington stopped being the capital of the United States, and started being the capital of the world.\u201d\n\nHe says he saw Trump charm Merkel and tell other leaders he didn\u2019t fault them for outmaneuvering America\u2019s past leaders but it stops with him.\n\nHe says Trump has not started any new wars and even convinced Democrats of China\u2019s threat.\n\n\u201cThe Washington elites want you to think this kind of foreign policy is immoral. And so they call it nationalist,\u201d he says. \u201cThat tells you all you need to know. The DC crowd thinks when they call Donald Trump a nationalist, they\u2019re insulting him. As if the American president isn\u2019t supposed to base foreign policy on America\u2019s national interests.\u201d\n\nRichard Grenell: \"The D.C. crowd think when they call Donald Trump a nationalist, they're insulting him. As if the American president isn't supposed to base foreign policy on America's national interests.\" https://t.co/Bu1ofYBbLe pic.twitter.com/mbItNplvtr \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) August 27, 2020\n\nHe says while Obama-Biden sent an airplane with cash to Iran, Trump \u201calso sent an aircraft in the middle of night to deal with Iran. But that plane was on a different mission \u2013 an air strike to take out the head of Iran\u2019s terror machine who plotted the deaths of Americans.\u201d\n\nAfter ripping Obama-Biden for spying on Trump officials and the Russia collusion hoax, Grenell explains Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy: America First does not advance the interests of one group of Americans at the expense of any other. It has no bias about red or blue, educated or not educated, urban or rural. America First is simply the belief that politicians should focus on the equality and dignity of every American. nd that this duty is fulfilled by promoting the safety and wealth of the American people above all else. That\u2019s America First. That\u2019s the Trump Doctrine. And that, my friends, is four more years.\u201d\n\n10:15 PM: Clarence Henderson, who participated in the Woolworth sit-ins, says he was born on the wrong side of the tracks, doesn\u2019t have a birth certificate, never attended integrated schools, is a civil rights activists\u2026and is a Republican who supports Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cIf that sounds strange to you, learn your history,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was the Republican Party that passed the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery; it was the Republican Party that passed the 14th Amendment giving black men citizenship; and it was the Republican Party that passed the 15th Amendment giving Black men the right to vote.\u201d\n\nC-SPAN\n\nHe adds that \u201cthere are African-American voters all over the country who the media is trying to convince to conform to the same old Democratic talking points. You know what that\u2019ll get you? The same old results.\u201d\n\nHe jabs Biden: \u201cJoe Biden had the audacity to say if you don\u2019t vote for him \u2018you ain\u2019t black.'\u201d Well to that, I say, if you do vote for Biden, you ain\u2019t smart!\u201d\n\nHe says Trump\u2019s policies show his heart and show that he cares about Black lives. He says Trump has done more for Blacks in four years than Biden has done in 50.\n\n10:12 PM: Sam Vigil says there is a hole in his heart since his wife Jackie, who was killed in her driveway, was taken from him.\n\n\u201cAlbuquerque, where we live, is one of the most violent cities in the country. Fewer than 50 percent of homicides are solved. It is a sad irony that Jackie immigrated to the U.S. for a better life than her native Colombia only to be gunned down in her own driveway,\u201d he says. \u201cFor over eight months, there were no arrests and no leads in connection with Jackie\u2019s murder. The police were overwhelmed. They needed help.\u201d\n\nHe says helped arrived with President Trump and the FBI took over Jackie\u2019s case. He says they arrested four men in a matter of days and the fifth, the suspected killer, is an illegal alien with a criminal record.\n\n\u201cHe had been deported in September and had come back in October to terrorize our community,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI am extremely grateful to President Trump and the FBI for their efforts to deliver justice for Jackie and all the other innocent victims of violent crime. I am honored to support the President because he is supporting us,\u201d he adds. \u201cI know he will never stop fighting for justice, for law and order, and for peace and security in our communities.\u201d\n\n10:05 PM: Lara Trump says never in a million years did she think she would be on that stage tonight or with the last name Trump. She talks about meeting the Trumps for the first time: \u201cAny preconceived notion I had of this family disappeared immediately. They were warm and caring, they were hard workers, and they were down to earth. They reminded me of my own family. They made me feel like I was home.\u201d\n\nShe also testifies about seeing so many women executives in the Trump organization.\n\n\u201cSo, it didn\u2019t surprise me when President Donald Trump appointed the most women to senior level positions of any administration in history. The Secretary of the United Nations, Secretary of the Air Force, the first female CIA Director, the first African American female director of the Fish and Wildlife service and countless ambassadors, just to name a few,\u201d she says. \u201cUnder President Trump\u2019s leadership women\u2019s unemployment hit the lowest level since World War II. 4.3 million new jobs have been created for women \u2014 in 2019 alone, women took over 70% of those new jobs. Female small business ownership remains at an all-time high. And 600,000 women have been lifted out of poverty, all since President Trump took office.\u201d\n\nShe says Trump did this not to gain a vote or check the box but because it was the right thing to do.\n\nShe says this is an election if we decided if we \u201ckeep America America.\u201d\n\nIn recent months, we\u2019ve seen weak, spineless politicians cede control of our great American cities to violent mobs. Defund the police is the rallying cry for the new, radical Democrat Party. Joe Biden will not do what it takes to maintain order. To keep our children safe in our neighborhoods and in their schools. To restore our American way of life,\u201d she says. \u201cWe cannot dare to dream our biggest dreams\u2013for ourselves or for our children \u2013while consumed by worry about the safety of our families. President Trump is the law and order president\u2013from our borders to our backyards.\u201d\n\n10:00 PM: House candidate Burgess Owens says he was raised in the South during the days of KKK and Jim Crow. He says after losing everything after his NFL career, he decided he could feel sorry for himself or get to work and he did by working as a chimney sweeper. He jabs Biden for saying you ain\u2019t black if you don\u2019t vote for him says that now, more than ever, \u201cwe need leaders who stand by their principles and won\u2019t compromise their values for political opportunities. Now, more than ever, we need leaders who will stand up to the lawlessness supported by the radical left.\u201d\n\nC-SPAN\n\nHe says business ownership among people of color have hit record highs while Trump has been in office and he is just getting started.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m running for Congress because we don\u2019t need more career politicians. We need a few more chimney sweeps,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need more leaders like President Trump who understand the freedoms that make up the fabric of America.\u201d\n\n9:57 PM: Sen. Ernst says the establishment media ignored the Iowa derechos because Iowa is still flyover country. She credits Trump for visiting Iowa and putting the devastation on the national media\u2019s radar. She says she can\u2019t recall a ticket that was more hostile to farmers than Obama-Biden unless you count Biden-Harris.\n\n\u201cThe Democratic Party of Joe Biden is pushing this so-called Green New Deal. If given power, they would essentially ban animal agriculture and eliminate gas-powered cars. It would destroy the agriculture industry, not just here in Iowa, but throughout the country. When the pandemic hit, President Trump heard us in our call for assistance for our farmers. Knowing we have an ally in the White House is important.\n\nFolks, this election is a choice between two very different paths,\u201d she says. \u201cFreedom, prosperity, and economic growth, under a Trump-Pence administration. Or, the Biden-Harris path. Paved by liberal coastal elites and radical environmentalist. An America where farmers are punished, jobs are destroyed, and taxes crush the middle class.\u201d\n\nC-SPAN\n\n9:50 PM: Rep. Zeldin says the post-9/11 generation \u201chuge shoes to fill following in the footsteps of veterans like those of our nation\u2019s greatest generation who once put humanity on their shoulders and saved the world.\u201d He speaks about how his two-week-old twin daughter went into septic shock and praise the Trump administration for supporting frontline workers with PPE.\n\n\u201cFor our nation to be even stronger, more prosperous, safer, freer and more secure than ever before, to make our country greater than ever, we must re-elect President Trump,\u201d he says. We are the land of the free, because of the brave, and we are the land of opportunity right now, because we have a President who wants to empower the best of who we are, to be the best of what we can be.\u201d\n\n9:47 PM: Chen Chuangcheng says the CCP is the enemy of humanity and is terrorizing its own people and threatening the well-being of the world.\n\n\u201cThe US must use its values of freedom, democracy, and the rule of law, to gather a coalition of other democracies to stop the CCP\u2019s aggression. President Trump has led on this and we need the other countries to join him in this fight. A fight for our future,\u201d he says.\n\n9:44 PM: Jack Brewer, a former NFL player and Democrat, says his child said \u201call lives matter\u201d and he figured out what so many still have not. He rips Biden for misrepresenting Trump\u2019s very fine people words about Charlottesville. He says he knows what racism looks like and rips the media for not giving Trump enough credit for what he has done for the black community.\n\n9:41 PM: Madison Cawthorn discusses the car accident that left him in a wheel chair and gave him a one percent chance of surviving. He mentions George Washington, Abe Lincoln, James Madison all changed the world in their twenties.\n\n\u201cWhile the radical left wants to dismantle, defund, and destroy, Republicans, under President Trump\u2019s leadership, want to rebuild, restore and renew,\u201d he says. He says political forces today \u201cwant to usher in the digital dark ages, a time of information without wisdom and tribalism without truth. National leaders on the left have normalized demagoguery and a radicalized identity politics that rejects\u201d Martin Luther King\u2019s dream that draws people from across the world to the United States.\n\nHe says be a radical for our republic for which he stands and then, with assistance, stands.\n\nMadison Cawthorn stands up from his wheelchair, as he concludes #RNC2020 speech: \u201cFor our republic for which I stand, one nation under God, with liberty and justice for all.\u201d The NC House GOP nominee would be the youngest member of Congress if elected. https://t.co/Bu1ofYBbLe pic.twitter.com/lHtbMpGizZ \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) August 27, 2020\n\n9:33 PM: Rep. Stefanik talks about how she represents the cradle of the American revolution. She mentions the Battle of Saratoga and the Miracle on Ice on Lake Placid. She says she has lived the American Dream and talk about how she comes from a small-business family and was the first in her family to graduate from college and became the youngest Republican woman to serve in Congress.\n\n\u201cI am honored to support President Trump for re-election because I know that he is the only candidate who will stand up for hardworking families and protect the American Dream for future generations,\u201d she says. \u201cSince his first day in office, President Trump has fought tirelessly to deliver results for all Americans, despite the Democrats\u2019 baseless and illegal impeachment sham and the media\u2019s endless obsession with it. I was proud to lead the effort standing up for the Constitution, President Trump, and most importantly the American people. This attack was not just on the President, it was an attack on you\u2013your voice and your vote.\u201d\n\nShe says more women are running for Congress as Republicans because they \u201cunderstand that this election is a choice between the far-left Democratic socialist agenda versus protecting and preserving the American Dream.\u201d\n\n9:30 PM: Michael McHale, the president of the National Association of Police Officers, says good officers need to know that their elected leaders have their backs. He says chaos results when leaders make the conscious decision not to support law enforcement. He says Biden has been taken over the by the radical left and Harris has supported legislation to further restrict police that would make America\u2019s streets more dangerous. He makes the case that Trump-Pence is the pro-law enforcement candidate.\n\n9:24 PM: Legendary college football coach Lou Holtz talk about his poor upbringing in a one-bedroom house in West Virginia. He says his parents taught him to never blame anyone else but there are politicians, professors, protesters, and Trump\u2019s naysayers who like to blame others for all of their problems and don\u2019t have pride in America.\n\n\u201cWhen I was an Army officer, I served with so many great Americans who embraced their responsibility to our country. I am so proud of their sacrifice and the opportunity it has provided for so many millions,\u201d Holtz says. \u201cAmerica remains the land of opportunity no matter what the other side says or believes.\u201d\n\nHe says Trump has his trust because he is the most pro-life president in history. Hold says the Biden-Harris ticket \u201cis the most radically pro-abortion campaign in history. They and other politicians are Catholics in Name Only and abandon innocent lives. President Trump protects those lives.\u201d\n\n9:21 PM: Sister Dede Byrne talks about her untraditional journey to religious life. She joined the Army as a medical student at Georgetown in 1978 to pay for tuition and devoted 29 years to the military, serving as a doctor and surgeon in places like Afghanistan and the Sinai Peninsula.\n\nShe says that \u201cwhile we tend to think of the marginalized as living beyond our borders, the truth is, the largest marginalized group in the world can be found in the United States. They are the unborn.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs Christians, we first met Jesus as a stirring embryo in the womb of an unwed mother and saw him born nine months later in the poverty of the cave. It\u2019s no coincidence that Jesus stood up for what was just and was ultimately crucified because what he said wasn\u2019t politically correct or fashionable,\u201d she says. \u201cAs followers of Christ, we are called to stand up for life and against the politically correct or fashionable today. We must fight against a legislative agenda that supports and even celebrates destroying life in the womb. In fact, the laws we create define how we see our humanity. And we must ask ourselves, what are we saying when we go into a womb and snuff out a powerless, voiceless life.\n\nShe continues: \u201cAs a physician, I can say unequivocally life begins at conception. While what I have to say may be difficult for some to hear, I am saying it because I\u2019m not just pro-life, I\u2019m pro-eternal life and I want all of us to end up in heaven together some day.\u201d\n\nShe says she is here because Trump is the most pro-life president the country has ever seen while Biden-Harris is the most anti-life ticket ever.\n\nIn RNC speech, Karen Pence talks about art therapy helping U.S. military veterans who are suffering from PTSD https://t.co/FyLIVYDKDn pic.twitter.com/tuwE4p880q \u2014 CBS News (@CBSNews) August 27, 2020\n\n9:05 PM: White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany talks about why she decided to get a mastectomy and how Trump called to check on her after he operation. She said she had only met Trump on a few occasions but she knows him well now.\n\n\u201cThe same way President Trump has supported me, he supports you. I see it every day,\u201d she says. She says she has heard Trump say the hardest part of his jobs is writing letters to the loved ones of fallen soldiers.\n\nMcEnany where says Trump will fight for an America where \u201cGod is cherished\u201d and \u201cnot taken out of our schools, removed from our Pledge, and erased from our history.\u201d\n\n8:58 PM: Next up is Tera Myers to talk about education freedom and her child with Down\u2019s Syndrome. She says she is thankful Trump values the life of the unborn. She says Trump did not dismiss her son and showed him he valued him and gave him an equal seat at the table. She thanks Trump for their work on education freedom.\n\nMansfield's Tera Myers speaking now at the #RNC about education issues. pic.twitter.com/OiSISJVXQm \u2014 Tyler Buchanan (@Tylerjoelb) August 27, 2020\n\n8:52 PM: Ret. Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg says Trump only cares about what is \u201cright for America\u201d when making foreign policy decisions.\n\n\u201cWhen President Donald Trump took office, decades of failed foreign policy had crippled us. He faced wars without end in sight, creation of failed states like Libya and Syria, a past that allowed a terrorist caliphate to grow, and leadership in Washington that allowed our military to atrophy while we spent trillions of dollars abroad instead of investing at home,\u201d Kellogg says. \u201cPresident Trump has reversed the decline of our military and restructured our national security strategy. With historic investment and vision, our military is now better equipped, better resourced and better manned than any military in the world.\u201d\n\nKellogg also says Trump \u201cdemolished the terrorist ISIS caliphate in the Middle East and eliminated its leader, al-Baghdadi, one of the world\u2019s most brutal murderers\u201d while taking \u201cdecisive action against Iranian terrorist mastermind Qasim Soleimani\u2014a man responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American servicemen in Iraq.\u201d\n\nHe also says Trump is no hawk, wisely wielding the sword when required and believing in seeking peace instead of perpetual conflict. He then praises Trump\u2019s peace deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates. He says this week, Afghan officials will start peace negotiations with the Taliban to end America\u2019s longest war.\n\n8:49 PM: Rep. Crenshaw says America has a long history of \u201cduty\u201d and \u201cour enemies fear us because Americans fight for good, and we know it gives us strength. And when our heroes are trusted and equipped, then freedom prevails.\u201d\n\nHe talks about the defeat of ISIS and the cowering of Iran being the result of America believing in heroes and her might.\n\n\u201cAmerica is a fabric woven from the threads of history\u2019s best stories, best attributes, and greatest ideas. The American spirit reflects the oldest and most important virtues: self-sacrifice, courage, tolerance, love of country, grace, and passion for human achievement,\u201d Crenshaw says. \u201cWe can decide right now that American greatness will not be rejected nor squandered. As the American founding was grounded in individual liberty, so will be our future.\u201d\n\n8:43 PM: Sen. Blackburn says America is a nation of heroes and, in times of difficulties we\u2019re reminded that they are all around us. She says she wants to talk about another type of hero, the types Democrats don\u2019t want to recognize because they don\u2019t fit into their narratives\u2013law enforcement officers.\n\n\u201cLeftists try to turn them into villains. They try to \u2018cancel\u2019 them. But I\u2019m here to tell you that these heroes can\u2019t be cancelled.\n\nTennessee is full of them\u2014after all, we\u2019re the volunteer state,\u201d she says before saying her dad served in the Army in WWII.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m reminded of him whenever I see compassion and selflessness in others,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I see law enforcement officers put their lives on the line every single day to keep our communities safe, in spite of the hatred thrown at them. When I see the heroes who volunteer to serve our country, putting their lives on the line for our freedom.\u201d\n\nShe says the common thread between them is that they don\u2019t believe the country owes them anything; they believe they owe their country.\n\n\u201cAs hard as Democrats try, they can\u2019t cancel our heroes. They can\u2019t contest their bravery, and they can\u2019t dismiss the powerful sense of service that lives deep in their souls,\u201d she says. \u201cSo they try to defund them \u2014our military, our police, even ICE \u2014 to take away their tools to keep us safe.\u201d\n\nBlackburn says Biden and Harris and their \u201cradical allies try to destroy these heroes, because if there are no heroes to inspire us\u2014government can control us.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey close our churches, but keep the liquor stores and abortion clinics open.

The administration just didn\u2019t seem to care. In 47 years in Washington, Joe Biden hasn\u2019t done anything for the timber industry.\u201d\n\nHe says under Trump, \u201cwe\u2019ve seen a new recognition of the value of forest management in reducing wildfires. And we\u2019ve seen new support for our way of life\u2014where a strong back and a strong work ethic can build a strong middle class.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to build families where we\u2019re raised and stand by communities that have stood by us,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want that way of life available for the next generation and we want our forests there too.\u201d\n\n8:31 PM: Night three opens with a prayer from Rabbi Aryeh Spero, president of the Conference of Jewish Affairs. After the pledge of allegiance, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem say she is here tonight because America is an exceptional nation founded on equality, freedom, and opportunity. She says our founding principles are under attack and this election is between a man who believes in these ideals and someone who doesn\u2019t and hasn\u2019t built anything. After citing James Madison extensively, she says Americans will not be a subclass of experts. Noem rips the violence of the mobs and says the people who can\u2019t afford to flee are left to fend for themselves.\n\n\u201cFrom Seattle and Portland to Washington and New York, Democrat-run cities across this country are being overrun by violent mobs. The violence is rampant. There\u2019s looting, chaos, destruction, and murder. People that can afford to flee have fled. But the people that can\u2019t, Good, hard-working Americans are left to fend for themselves,\u201d she says. \u201cThe Republican Party\u2019s commitment to individual rights and self-government is as necessary today as it was in 1860 when we won our first presidential election.\u201d\n\nGov.

There are resources to help you do that. The Wisconsin governor rejected, according to the White House chief of staff, additional resources and National Guard before the most horrific night we\u2019ve seen this week in Kenosha. This is a choice that they are making not to stop the violence initially.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cI have to say on the argument of vigilante justice when you have no police around to defend businesses and people who are being attacked, and their livelihoods burned to the ground, then there is a void that is filled. You have to ask yourself when resources are offered at the beginning of when these riots break out and rejected by Democratic leaders over and over again. You have to ask the question, why?\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cThis is a pattern of behavior, not just now. You\u2019ll remember, in Baltimore a couple of years ago, when the mayor said she gave the \u201cprotesters room to destroy,\u201d and they completely went through the city and ruined everything, This is a pattern of behavior which Democratic leaders are not capable of defending their cities and the people who live within them.\u201d\n\nFollowing a commercial break, Wallace said, \u201cI\u2019ve got to push back on something we said at the end of the last segment because there seemed to be the implication that somehow vigilante justice was understandable or justified by the lack of sufficient police action and authority and presence in some of these cities.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cJust as it is fair to say that rioting and looting is a completely inappropriate response to George Floyd or Jacob Blake, vigilante justice is a completely inappropriate response to the rioting in the street. There is no justification for what happened in Kenosha, and vigilante justice is a crime and should be punished as a crime.\u201d\n\nHost Harris Faulkner interjected, \u201cWe did not say that, and now we have said it. We did not say that before.\u201d\n\nWallace shot back, \u201cYou were saying \u2018fill a void\u2019 and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nFaulkner said, \u201cThe one thing that Melissa said is nobody is saying that the right thing to do.

Pecknold, a professor at the Catholic University of America, to tweet slyly, \u201cThe internal polling must be really bad.\u201d Pecknold was referring, of course, to the growing realization, reinforced by survey data, that the Democrats\u2019 soft-on-rioters stance is starting to erode their chances in the November balloting. In fact, already on August 13, the Pew Center found that 59 percent of Americans said that crime was a \u201cvery important\u201d issue in 2020.\n\nSince then, of course, the crime situation has worsened, as Kenosha has gone up in flames, while Democrat politicians have done little, or even, seemingly, encouraged the rioters\u2014here\u2019s looking at you, Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers. Moreover, it\u2019s becoming clear that this lenience toward crime could hurt the entire Democrat ticket.\n\nIndeed, even Democrats\u2019 best friends in the Main Stream Media are starting to get, and share, that message of concern. As CNN anchor Don Lemon told Chris Cuomo on August 25, \u201cKenosha is a Rorschach test for the entire country. I think this is a blind spot for Democrats. I think Democrats are hoping this will go away, and it\u2019s not going to go away.\u201d\n\nThe CNN man\u2019s words of warning might lead one to conclude that Lemon, as well as Bowser, has seen warning-flag survey numbers. In fact, that\u2019s exactly what Lemon said: \u201cI know it\u2019s showing up in the polling, it\u2019s showing up in focus groups. It is the only thing right now that is sticking.\u201d\n\nInterestingly, Lemon didn\u2019t always worry about rioting. Just three months ago, Breitbart News reported that he described the riots as a \u201cmechanism\u201d for the needed \u201crestructuring\u201d of the country. As he said on May 30, \u201cPerhaps this is some sort of mechanism for a restructure in our country or some sort of change in our country for us to deal with whatever we need to deal with in this country as we look at pictures on the right of burning and pictures on the left of looting.\u201d\n\nYet now, it seems that too many pictures of burning and looting have taken their toll on the Democrats\u2019 standing. An August 26 poll from Milwaukee\u2019s Marquette University found support for Black Lives Matter in the Badger State to be tumbling. These findings led liberal journalist Jonathan Chait to observe, \u201cDemocrats need to be extremely concerned about what\u2019s happening in Wisconsin, where support for BLM has gone from +25 to +0 in 2 months.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Meghan McCain, definitely not a Trump fan, tweeted Lemon\u2019s September 25 comments and added her own assessment:\n\nEverything @donlemon said here is accurate. This is the one issue that could really turn the election against Biden and is showing up in the polling \u2013 all leaders have to come out forcefully and unequivocally against violence and looting.\n\nAnd journalist Matt Lewis, another non-fan of Trump, sighed, \u201cThis is how Trump wins.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Republicans, sensing the political opportunity, are piling on. In his Wednesday night speech to the Republican convention, Vice President Mike Pence was firm as he added yet another city to the list of Democrat urban war zones: \u201cLet me be clear: The violence must stop, whether in Minneapolis, Portland, or Kenosha . . . We will have law and order on the streets of this country for every American of every race and creed and color.\u201d\n\nThen Pence zeroed in on the nation\u2019s top Democrat: \u201cJoe Biden says America is \u2018systemically racist,\u2019 and that law enforcement in America has a quote \u2018implicit bias\u2019 against minorities.\u201d Continuing, Pence added, \u201cThe hard truth is, you won\u2019t be safe in Joe Biden\u2019s America.\u201d By contrast, \u201cUnder President Trump, we will stand with those who stand on the Thin Blue Line.\u201d And Pence\u2019s words were bolstered by others speaking at the convention, including Donald Trump Jr., Rep. Jim Jordan, and Rep. Dan Crenshaw.\n\nIn the face of this Republican onslaught, the MSM is realizing that its familiar mantra, that these are just \u201cpeaceful protestors\u201d\u2014with, okay, just a little bit of arson and violence\u2014is wearing thin.\n\nThus the new MSM mantra is to warn the Democrats; hence this warning-siren headline in the New York Times: \u201cHow Chaos in Kenosha is Already Swaying Some Voters.\u201d As the Times put it, \u201cAs residents see fires and looting, some worry that local Democratic leaders are failing to keep control of the situation.\u201d We can pause to observe that the newspaper is putting the onus on local, as opposed to national Democrats. It seems that Wisconsin\u2019s Democrat governor might be expendable, but not, of course, the Democrat presidential nominee.\n\nIn fact, that same day, August 27, Politico went further, connecting the burning of Main Street to the incineration of Democrats\u2019 hopes for 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue; the headline on its piece bannered, \u201cIt\u2019s playing into Trump\u2019s hands\u2019: Dems fear swing-state damage from Kenosha unrest.\u201d The article, datelined from the embattled Wisconsin city, detailed, \u201cAs this battleground state grapples with social unrest, some Democrats fear that the looting and rioting and clashes are feeding Trump\u2019s argument that this is what life would be like under the so-called radical left.\u201d\n\nSo we can see: Reasons for Democrats to afraid, very afraid, are mounting. As CNN\u2019s Lemon said on the 25th, referring to Biden\u2019s quiet position vis-a-vis the rioters, \u201cHe\u2019s got to address it.\u201d Yet then Lemon added something revealing: He suggested that the former vice president might not, in fact, be willing to address the riots in a meaningful way: \u201cI think maybe Joe Biden may be afraid to do it. I\u2019m not sure.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Biden has been hesitant to say much of anything except, maybe, to blame the police. On August 24, he posted on Facebook declaring, \u201cThis morning, the nation wakes up yet again with grief and outrage that yet another Black American is a victim of excessive force. This calls for an immediate, full and transparent investigation and the officers must be held accountable.\u201d Here we can see the Gov. Tony Evers-ish presumption that the police are the bad guys, that they used \u201cexcessive force.\u201d Then Biden added this hat-tip to the far left: \u201cWe must dismantle systemic racism. It is the urgent task before us.\u201d\n\nSuch words will reassure the left wing of the Democrat Party, which has regarded Biden as too \u201cmoderate.\u201d And yet Team Biden is now being warned that it can\u2019t win with just the left, and that rhetoric that puts the burden, even the outright blame, on the cops isn\u2019t going to help his cause.\n\nIndeed, in the midst of this fiery new crime wave, the betting odds on the election, while still favoring Biden to win, have narrowed sharply, from a margin of +24 on August 5 to just +8 on August 27.\n\nSeeming to sense his vulnerability, on August 28 Biden gave his riot-messaging another try, adding a video statement on Facebook in which he said, \u201cNeedless violence won\u2019t heal us. We need to end the violence\u2014and peacefully come together to demand justice.\u201d Those words can be read as a gentle reproach to the rioters in Wisconsin, and maybe even the shouters and screamers in D.C., although, of course, it doesn\u2019t mention either by name. Biden just can\u2019t seem to bring himself to condemn the rioters.\n\nIf we were inclined to, we could sympathize with Biden. He\u2019s the man atop an increasingly left-wing party, trying to win a national election in a centrist country that worries, more and more, about crime and unrest. And so Biden is, well, tongue-tied, because whatever he says on the subject will antagonize some group of listeners.\n\nSo that\u2019s why Biden seems happy saying as little as possible about the rioting. Indeed, he seems happy not saying much of anything.\n\nThat yearning for the sound of silence might explain why House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a close Biden ally, suggested on the 27th that Biden not debate President Trump, which would undo a presidential campaign tradition going back to 1976. For his part, Biden has said that he looks forward to debating Trump, and yet he has hinted at odd pre-conditions, such as demanding the onstage presence of a \u201cfact-checker,\u201d which suggest that maybe he\u2019s not so eager, after all, to debate the incumbent president. So perhaps there\u2019s some complicated maneuvering going on here, as Pelosi sends up trial balloons to see what might be politically feasible. In any case, in campaign terms, it\u2019s a long time between now and the first scheduled presidential debate, on September 29.\n\nSo this seems to be the strategy from Team Biden: Say as little as possible, period. In fact, in quiet times, such quietude might have been a plausible plan for the Democrats; that is, if Biden is in the lead, let him sit on that lead, quietly, between now and November 3.\n\nYet these are tempestuous times; the plain reality is that the rioting requires a loud and robust response; Americans want to hear from both presidential candidates as to their plan to restore law and order. (Having, say, D.C.\u2019s full-throated mayor, Muriel Bowser, substitute for Biden in the debates will not suffice, and probably not even Kamala Harris.)\n\nThe fact is, Joe Biden is going to have to speak for himself on the key issue of keeping the streets of America safe. And that\u2019s a reality that threatens to really bite the Democrats over the next ten weeks.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2020/08/27/pinkerton-riot-reality-is-biting-the-democrats/", "published": "2020-08-27T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Minneapolis: Over 50 People Arrested After Violent Unrest and Looting", "text": "Over 50 people were arrested in Minneapolis following violent unrest and looting, the chief of the Minneapolis Police Department said Thursday.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (D) implemented a curfew, while Gov.

An Organization of American States (OAS) investigation into the October 2019 election found evidence of fraud favoring Morales.\n\nFollowing his voluntary resignation, Morales claimed he was the victim of a \u201ccoup\u201d and fled to Mexico, then Argentina, where the socialist government has granted him political asylum. Morales remains the leader of Bolivians \u201cMovement Towards Socialism\u201d (MAS) party from abroad.\n\n\u201cToday \u2026 documentation has been received regarding a possible new case of rape, presumably committed by ex-President Evo Morales,\u201d Guido Melgar, Bolivia\u2019s minister of transparency, told reporters on Monday. \u201cThe documentation indicates that a young lady [named] N.N. had a romantic relationship with Evo Morales and became pregnant when she was 15 years and five months old, having a daughter in February 2016, when she was 16.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe minor exists, the mother exists, and the minor has registered as her father Juan Evo Morales Ayma,\u201d Melgar explained.\n\nProsecutors in Cochabamba, the jurisdiction where the case would fall, confirmed on Monday that criminal charges exist against Morales for rape and human trafficking. The next day, Javier Issa, Bolivia\u2019s vice minister of the Department of the Interior, told reporters that police have compiled photographic evidence indicating that the accusations are true. Issa said that the discovery of photos appearing to show Morales in compromising positions with minors was \u201ca matter of chance,\u201d as the Bolivian newspaper P\u00e1gina Siete reported \u2014 police discovered the photos after arresting a minor at a party violating Chinese coronavirus lockdown restrictions who appeared to have ties to Morales.\n\nMorales addressed the claims in an interview with the leftist radio program Kawsachun Coca this weekend, reminding the public that he has faced other paternity claims in the past and denying that he had committed any crime.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t discuss [female] comrades in political matters,\u201d Morales insisted. \u201cAll I will tell you is that, during the 2014 elections, some will remember, a case surfaced of a [female] comrade that I had allegedly impregnated, she said she was 55. \u2026 I said, \u2018if you have evidence, put me on trial.'\u201d\n\nMorales insisted that right-wing \u201ccoup plotters\u201d were behind the accusations.\n\nOther news outlets have noted that Morales faced similar paternity claims in 2016, as well.\n\n\u201cAll that stuff about rape and pedophilia, everybody knew about that when Evo Morales was president,\u201d Rub\u00e9n Costas, the governor of Bolivia\u2019s Santa Cruz department, the nation\u2019s equivalent of provinces or states, told reporters on Monday, suggesting that the allegations were true. \u201cWe knew and it was all covered up. That\u2019s what happens when power is managed in a vile way and all the institutions are bought off \u2026 nobody could do anything about the charges, nothing happened.\u201d\n\nPresident Jeanine \u00c1\u00f1ez \u2014 a conservative senator who became commander-in-chief after Morales and everyone above her on the chain of command fled the country \u2014 called the accusations against Morales \u201cunforgivable\u201d on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cAll these acts should be punished, we are in favor of respecting women, children, but we had a president who hid all of that, it will not remain unpunished, this is unforgivable and outrageous for all Bolivians,\u201d \u00c1\u00f1ez said.\n\nThe child who allegedly gave birth to Morales\u2019 daughter is the second identified this month as a potential Morales victim. The first is a woman believed to be currently 19 years old, but who was underage at the time that photos allegedly of her and Morales indicating a romantic relationship were taken. The photos, and her full identity, appeared in the Spanish outlet OK Diario, which did not independently confirm the relationship, only the police investigation into the matter.\n\nThe woman in question released a statement last week saying that police in Bolivia had forced her to claim she had engaged in a sexual relationship with Morales and had traveled to Mexico and Argentina to see him following his resignation.\n\n\u201cI have been the victim of police harassment,\u201d the girl said in a statement published anonymously in Bolivian media. \u201cThere were various police officers at all times who called me a liar, insulted me, said bad words to me, made fun of me. They told me, \u2018say that you are Evo\u2019s girlfriend, that you traveled to Mexico and Argentina.'\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom July 6 on, my life has been a nightmare,\u201d the statement read.\n\nThe known criminal charges against Morales, which \u00c1\u00f1ez\u2019s government has vowed to take to international court, regard his calls from abroad for mob violence to force his reinstatement as president. In December, Bolivian officials published audio of what they claimed to be Morales\u2019 voice ordering a senior labor union leader, \u201cdo not let food into the cities,\u201d hoping to starve residents into allowing his return to power.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2020/08/25/bolivian-government-evo-morales-may-have-fathered-child-minor/", "published": "2020-08-25T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Brazil: Bolsonaro Tells Reporter \u2018I Want to Stuff Your Mouth with Punches\u2019", "text": "Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro appears to have recovered from his bout of Chinese coronavirus with his combative spirit intact, as he threatened to punch a reporter in the face on Sunday in response to a question about possible links between his wife and a corruption scandal.\n\nA reporter from the newspaper O Globo asked Bolsonaro on Sunday about a story in a different publication that linked First Lady Michelle Bolsonaro to the president\u2019s old friend Fabricio Queiroz, a former police officer and until recently an adviser to Flavio Bolsonaro, the president\u2019s 39-year-old son and a sitting member of the Brazilian Senate.\n\nFlavio Bolsonaro has been embroiled in a corruption probe since last year, an investigation his father denounced as a political hit job.

It sounds incongruous, but that\u2019s how things go down here. An obliterated oil industry with crumbling refineries (courtesy of the ruling Socialist Party), zero oil rigs left operating in the nation, and the latest seizure of the palliative Iranian fuel shipment means that there\u2019s no apparent end to this crisis in sight.\n\nGasoline shortages aren\u2019t a new phenomenon for us. It is an ongoing and recurring problem, a cycle that gets worse with each new spin of the wheel, and yet another consequence of the past years of utter socialist collapse. But they\u2019ve never been this severe before, and the whole situation has not just made our lives more miserable, it\u2019s even caused a cultural shock for my fellow citizens.\n\nYou don\u2019t know what you have until it\u2019s gone, and gasoline is one thing you can add to Venezuela\u2019s ever-growing list of lost treasures, along with freedom of speech, a functional currency, and even hope itself. Absurdly cheap gasoline (to the point that it might as well be free) was our one prerogative as a nation. It used to be cheaper than the simplest bottle of water, or even bubblegum.\n\nWe certainly had a plethora of problems here, but having to worry about fuel efficiency wasn\u2019t one of them. Not anymore, though. You have to be extremely frugal with what fuel you can pump into your vehicle, down to the last drop, because it\u2019s not like we can simply go to a fuel station and do the deed at our earliest convenience.\n\nIn terms of queuing for gasoline, August has been exceptionally dire. As the capital and seat of power of the \u201cBolivarian, Socialist, Anti-imperialist, and profoundly Chavista\u201d Revolution, Caracas often suffers the least when it comes to shortages of any kind, so when the shortages begin to hit the capital then you know it\u2019s bad.\n\nThe second week of August 2020 saw 46 of Caracas\u2019 fuel stations without fuel or close to running out, and it got progressively worse throughout the week. If you\u2019re not in Caracas then you\u2019d best be prepared to spend an entire week camping on your vehicle for a few liters of fuel. You might as well bring a tent and chill because, my friend, the ride never ends.\n\nWhen you\u2019re a socialist regime and you can\u2019t quell or mask inhumanely long lines, what do you do? You make them illegal, of course.\n\nThe chief of the Integral Defense Operations Zones for the State of Lara has recently announced that overnight queuing at a gas station for fuel is now strictly forbidden. This may be outrageous to you, but for us, it\u2019s nothing new. In 2015, the same tactic was applied to supermarkets to obfuscate the long lines of people waiting for food:\n\n#Lara | En la zona del Tri\u00e1ngulo del Este, en Barquisimeto, la GN y PNB amenaza a trav\u00e9s de sus altavoces para que retiren los veh\u00edculos, sino ser\u00e1n remolcados.

If you\u2019re at one of the fuel stations that offer subsidized fuel, it gets debited from your monthly 120-litre allowance via the regime\u2019s Chinese-inspired Fatherland system.\n\nAs the socialist system\u2019s monthly allotments are assigned to individuals rather than vehicles, people have begun to transfer their monthly quotas among themselves, either via the system itself or by simply being present at the moment of refueling. The system, however, will only grant allotments to people with registered vehicles, which I am unable to complete due to a bureaucratic paperwork conundrum.\n\nThus, for all intents and purposes, I am part of the group of people who do not have access to subsidized gasoline, which makes me a second-rate citizen within the framework of this crisis.\n\nChinese coronavirus quarantine notwithstanding, a few protests have erupted throughout this ongoing calamity \u2013 some more peaceful than others.

For some, fuel can be a matter of life and death.\n\nLike water, power, food, and medicine, gasoline shortages and rations are here to stay as part of the next stage in the inexorable collapse of socialist Venezuela.

They have also accused Maduro of funding and supporting Marxist guerilla groups that have destabilized Colombia over the past two decades, such as the People\u2019s Liberation Army (ELN), that continue to carry out terrorist attacks against security forces and the civilian population.\n\nJust this week, Iran showcased its weapons capability by highlighting new surface-to-surface ballistic and cruise missiles in an obvious rebuke to the United States, which is demanding the regime halt its weapons program. According to Defense Minister Amir Hatami, the two missiles were produced by Iranian scientists and boast a range of over 1,000 kilometers and are named after the Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, whom the U.S. killed in a drone strike this year.\n\nMeanwhile, Maduro has long prioritized military spending over just about everything, demanding loyalty from high-ranking generals in return for high salaries and effective impunity.\n\nRelations between Iran and Venezuela have become closer throughout the past few years, the two countries strengthening their alliance in response to economic sanctions the U.S. imposed against their respective regimes. Signs of this relationship include the growing number of oil shipments sent from Tehran, the opening of Persian supermarkets in Caracas, and reports that Maduro is allowing Iranian terror-proxy Hezbollah to use Venezuela as its Latin American operating base.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Parler, Facebook, or Twitter.

Joaquin Castro: \u2018Latinos Love Hollywood, But Hollywood Hates Latinos\u2019", "text": "Far-left Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-TX) launched a scathing rebuke of Hollywood and the film industry on Monday, declaring the need for a \u201creckon[ing] with its systemic injustice and exclusion of our communities.\u201d\n\nIn a guest column for Variety magazine entitled \u201cLatinos Love Hollywood, but Hollywood Hates Latinos,\u201d Castro points out the fact that Hispanic actors are indeed underrepresented in film. The Texas Democrat also accuses the industry of casting and depicting Latinos as negative stereotypes, particularly people who are criminals or angry antagonists.\n\nHe wrote:\n\nThe entertainment industry is the main narrative-creating and image-defining institution of American society. Unfortunately, Latinos are often depicted as stereotypes, if we\u2019re represented at all. A study by the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative found that Latinos had a speaking role in less than 5% of movies. Of these characters, nearly 50% were criminals or \u201cangry.\u201d These negative depictions are often the only images that millions of Americans see. Even when positive stories do get told, they are often overlooked by the awards shows that could encourage more production. Let\u2019s not forget: Generations of Latino actors have felt forced to change their name, even their appearance, to be included in roles, forfeiting their heritage and robbing our community of role models and dreams of being seen on-screen.\n\nCastro went on to argue that the situation is so serious that it needs a form of government intervention, complaining how the industry is already subsidized by taxpayer dollars:\n\nAt the heart of this failure of representation is the lack of diversity in the industry, especially among those in positions of creative authority, such as writers, producers, directors and executives. Latinos prop up Hollywood economically, accounting for nearly one in four of all box office ticket sales, but they account for a mere 4% of directors and 3% of producers. This cannot be an accident in a city like Los Angeles, where Latinos are nearly half the population. Hollywood is in effect a redlined industry, generating wealth and opportunity for the handful of conglomerates who run it while excluding the hardworking Latinos who live all around it. The case for government intervention is clear: Hollywood is failing to include Latinos on its own, meriting increased scrutiny from community leaders and elected officials. Taxpayer dollars flowing to an exclusionary industry, particularly in the form of production credits, deserve special attention. Why should we subsidize exclusion?\n\nIt is not the first time that Castro and Democrats in Congress have called out Hollywood for overlooking Latinos. Last month, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (of which Castro is the leader) slammed the Emmy Awards for their \u201cerasure\u201d of Latino actors after not a single actor was nominated for an award.\n\n\u201cThere is not a single Latino or Latina nominated for [The Emmy] awards,\u201d the Caucus, which comprises solely of Democrats, wrote at the time. \u201cA demoralizing disappointment for the U.S.\u2019s largest minority group, representing nearly 1-in-5 Americans. Hollywood must acknowledge and address the erasure of Latinx actors.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, left-wing activist groups such as the National Hispanic Media Coalition and National Latino Media Council even boycotted Paramount Pictures and demonstrated outside their studios for their \u201cdismal hiring record of Latino talent.\u201d The company responded by pledging to continue fostering an environment of \u201cdiversity, inclusion and belonging.\u201d\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Parler, Facebook, or Twitter.

Beaches are closed because of the pandemic, although these restrictions are routinely ignored.\n\n\u201cIf we had steady work, we wouldn\u2019t risk our lives out there,\u201d 35-year-old Juan Carlos Almeida told the agency. \u201cWe\u2019re bricklayers, but there\u2019s no construction\u2026 If we don\u2019t help ourselves and don\u2019t go to work, who\u2019s going to feed us?

There is also the risk of being bitten by a shark should they try to grab their catch. Once arriving back onshore, swimmers are often forced to walk for miles holding their catch to return home.\n\nSuch voyages underline the dire circumstances faced by millions of Venezuelans, as the country\u2019s economic situation is exacerbated by lockdown measures imposed by the socialist regime since March. In February, a study from the United Nations Food Program determined that one in three Venezuelans (roughly 9.3 million) are facing severe hunger, with this figure only likely to have risen as quarantine measures have put millions of people out of work.\n\nLike many parts of Latin America, Venezuela has experienced a surge in coronavirus cases over the past six weeks, reporting 33,755 and 281 deaths.

Instead, officials threatened ship owners, insurers, and captains with targeted sanctions to make them hand over their cargo.\n\nAccording to another official, the four tankers were headed for Venezuela to deliver 1.1 million barrels of gasoline, a resource which the country is currently desperately short on. However, the seizure meant they never arrived at their destination and went missing, with two of the ships later showing up on the island of Cape Verde in the central Atlantic Ocean. They have since remained unaccounted for.\n\nThe Justice Department confirmed the incident late Friday morning, declaring it as the \u201clargest-ever seizure of fuel shipments\u201d from Iran:\n\nThe Justice Department today announced the successful disruption of a multimillion dollar fuel shipment by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a designated foreign terrorist organization, that was bound for Venezuela. These actions represent the government\u2019s largest-ever seizure of fuel shipments from Iran. The government announced today that it has successfully executed the seizure order and confiscated the cargo from all four vessels, totaling approximately 1.116 million barrels of petroleum. With the assistance of foreign partners, this seized property is now in U.S. custody.\n\nAccording to the statement, the Iranians then attempted to recover the shipments by boarding an \u201cunrelated ship\u201d in what was described as an \u201cunsuccessful\u201d operation:\n\nAfter enforcement of the U.S. forfeiture order, Iran\u2019s navy forcibly boarded an unrelated ship in an apparent attempt to recover the seized petroleum but was unsuccessful. U.S. Central Command published a video of the failed Iranian operation yesterday. Funds successfully forfeited with a connection to a state sponsor of terrorism may in whole or in part be directed to the United States Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund.\n\nResponding to the initial reports, the Iranian ambassador to Venezuela, Hojat Soltani, dismissed the reports as \u201cyet another lie and psychological warfare\u201d by the United States.\n\n\u201cThe ships are not Iranian, and neither the owner nor its flag has anything to do with Iran,\u201d Soltani wrote on Twitter in Spanish. \u201cThis is another lie and act of psychological warfare perpetrated by the US propaganda machine.

The widespread shortages have led to multiple fuel protests as people are forced to wait hours or even days to access gasoline, while no longer enjoying the government subsidies that allowed them to repeatedly fill up their vehicles for just a fraction of a cent.\n\nThe seizure will be seen in Washington as a victory for the Trump administration\u2019s policy of maximum pressure against the Maduro regime, which has so far failed to remove him from power despite imposing an array of tough economic sanctions against senior socialist officials and the country\u2019s vital oil industry.\n\nWith both countries under economic sanctions, the alliance between Iran and Venezuela has become closer over the past few years. As well as multiple oil shipments, the two rogue states have started initiatives such as the opening of an Iranian supermarket in Caracas and the signing of various \u201cscientific and technological\u201d agreements aimed at tightening cultural, diplomatic, and economic ties.\n\nThe close relationship, forged by socialist dictator Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in the early 21st century, is also increasingly considered as a threat to U.S. national security, as the Maduro regime is believed to be permitting Iran\u2019s terror proxy Hezbollah to use Venezuelan territory as a base to expand their operations across Latin America.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Parler, Facebook, or Twitter.

The federal legislature, the National Assembly, used its constitutional powers to make Guaid\u00f3 interim president, with a mandate to organize free and fair elections to replace Maduro.\n\nAs Maduro commands the loyalty of the armed forces and Venezuela banned the civilian ownership of firearms under late dictator Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Guaid\u00f3 has no access to any organized force and has not been able to exercise any of his constitutional powers. The president has also faced repeated physical assaults at the hand of Maduro\u2019s armed socialist gangs, known as colectivos.\n\nMost of the free world recognizes Guaid\u00f3\u2019s legitimacy, however, and has offered support in the form of accepting Guaid\u00f3-appointed Venezuelan ambassadors.\n\nIn April 2019, Guaid\u00f3 declared that he had convinced the nation\u2019s armed forces to support him and overthrow Maduro. Within hours, Maduro appeared on television alongside his minister of defense and other senior military leaders refuting Guaid\u00f3\u2019s claim. No significant number of soldiers defected to Guaid\u00f3 and Maduro still retains control of the military at press time.\n\nThe Trump administration recognized Guaid\u00f3 as president following his swearing-in. Trump welcomed Guaid\u00f3 as his personal guest at the 2020 State of the Union speech.

A wide majority, 73.8 percent, said they supported the implementation of a new government; 77.6 percent said they wished to see an end to the Maduro regime and chavismo in general. A similar number, 76.7 percent, agreed with the phrase \u201csocialism guarantees misery, regression, and destroys the future.\u201d\n\nThat rejection of socialism also informed views of Guaid\u00f3, as 66.5 of respondents said they considered Guaid\u00f3 himself a \u201csocialist.\u201d\n\nThe July iteration of Megan\u00e1lisis\u2019s semi-monthly national poll also found decreased support for Guaid\u00f3. At the time, 78.8 percent of respondents said they wished to see Trump stop supporting Guaid\u00f3\u2019s bid for the presidency. Asked, \u201cdo you think Guaid\u00f3 is a weak politician?\u201d, 83.1 percent said \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nLike the July survey, Venezuelans told Megan\u00e1lisis in May, by a factor of nearly 90 percent, that they did not believe Guaid\u00f3 capable of running the country.\n\nA \u201ctell-all\u201d book by former U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton claimed this year that Trump appeared to agree with the 83 percent, claiming that the president expressed reservations about supporting a \u201ckid\u201d like Guaid\u00f3, who made Maduro looked \u201ctough.\u201d Maduro has been in power since 2013, extending his rule through disingenuous calls for \u201cdialogue\u201d with opposition leaders affiliated with the Socialist International.

The Castro regime forces tens of thousands of doctors around the world to work in dangerous locales that domestic doctors do not tend to, offering them a percentage of the salaries the host country agreed to that is not enough for them to survive.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal estimated in 2019 that Cuba makes about $11 billion in 60 countries around the world selling slave doctors. The Organization of American States (OAS) denounced the practice in December as \u201chuman trafficking.\u201d\n\nRojas joined the program as a trained orthopedics specialist in 2014. The Castro regime sent him to Ecuador, ruled at the time by socialist ally Rafael Correa (Ecuador has since ordered Correa\u2019s arrest, though he fled to Belgium). There, Rojas said that his main task as a doctor was to spread socialist propaganda in an attempt to boost popular support for Correa.\n\n\u201cAll the medical missions have a political ulterior motive,\u201d Rojas said in an interview with the Foundation for Human Rights in Cuba, as relayed by the independent news outlet Cubanet.\n\n\u201cAll those who leave [Cuba] for a medical mission have to pass two political courses where they explain to us that the main source of remittances to Cuba are the medical missions.

His wife has since legally separated from him, as well, causing more trauma to the children.\n\n\u201cMy daughter especially has been hurt by the family separation,\u201d he explained in the Archivo Cuba interview. \u201cMy daughter was diagnosed with histrionic personality disorder and a year ago she tried to commit suicide. I traveled to Cuba urgently then and the Cuban government banned me from going in to come in. I was [stuck] in the airport ten hours without being let in.\u201d\n\nHistrionic personality disorder is a psychiatric condition in which a patient shows \u201can overwhelming desire to be noticed, and often behave dramatically or inappropriately to get attention,\u201d according to the Cleveland Clinic. Threatening to or attempting to commit suicide, sometimes in such a bid for attention, is listed as a symptom and \u201cunpredictable attention given to a child by his or her parent(s)\u201d as a potential cause.\n\n\u201cThere are thousands of families in the same situation as me or even worse,\u201d Rojas said. \u201cI lost my father in Cuba. I couldn\u2019t go to the island then either. I lost the father who raised me, just like my biological father \u2026 I have lost two uncles very close to me. I have seen my mom suffer, cry.\u201d\n\nFamily separations and abuses in the host countries are part of a documented pattern of witness experiences listed by doctors who defect regardless of the country the regime sent them to. Outside of the United States, in Brazil, defecting doctors have launched a class-action lawsuit against the former socialist government there and the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), a subdivision of the World Health Organization (W.H.O.), which intervened to ensure the deal between Cuba and Brazil did not violent international sanctions.\n\nDoctors participating in that lawsuit described a fraudulent and abusive system in a press conference last year, noting that they often fabricated data and threw away medicine to appear more productive than they were. When they did meet patients, the regime obligated them to pressure the patients into supporting local socialists.\n\nIn Venezuela, where many of them worked, the Cuban dictatorship \u201chad us under constant harassment and stress,\u201d doctor Tatiana Carballo said last year. \u201cThe thing that bothers me the most is that they made us falsify statistics and \u2026 to influence the population politically \u2014 in other words, to force Venezuelans, against their will, to vote for Maduro or Ch\u00e1vez.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey tell us often in Cuba that education is free, therefore we are their property,\u201d Carballo said of Cuban regime agents. \u201cFrom the moment we graduate, we receive very, very low salaries, then begin medical missions abroad.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had to tell patients about the positive things the Maduro regime was doing and influence the vote,\u201d Fidel Cruz, another defecting doctor, said. \u201cI had to go door-to-door to incentivize people to vote for Maduro during the last election.\u201d\n\nRamona Matos, another doctor at the press conference, testified to fabricating data.\n\n\u201cOn a daily basis, you had to write on a piece of paper fake names, fake dates of birth, fake medical conditions, for patients we never saw,\u201d she said, referring to her world in Bolivia under socialist ex-president Evo Morales. \u201cThese were statistics the agents following and controlling us forced us to write.

However, a source within the state-run Petroleum of Venezuela (PDSVA) confirmed to Reuters that the oil likely spilled from a ship\u2019s fuel tank and that the company would assist in the cleanup.\n\nAs well as the potentially devastating environmental impact of the oil itself, the incident represents the latest embarrassment to the Maduro regime as the country struggles with widespread gasoline shortages that are forcing people to wait hours or even days to fill up their vehicles.\n\nAs a result of the shortages, many Venezuelans have held fuel protests in recent months demanding an end to shortages. Despite having the largest oil reserves in the world after the United States, the country\u2019s economic and humanitarian crisis has led to a drastic decline in oil production. In June, overall production reportedly fell for the sixth month running, decreasing by a further 32 percent, forcing authorities to import reserves from allies such as Russia, China, and Iran.\n\nVenezuelans are now also required to provide biometric data when filling up, checked against the government\u2019s database using the \u201cFatherland Card,\u201d developed by communist China as a way of spying on citizens\u2019 behavior and spending habits. Although fuel prices are still relatively low (around $0.025 a liter), this is still extremely costly for the millions of people living on just a few dollars a month. The regime charges those who exceed the quota they set at $0.50 per liter, meaning only the wealthy can afford to buy a full gas tank.\n\nFollow Ben Kew on Parler, Facebook, or Twitter.

Yet after two decades of socialist rule and the seizure of its major oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, its oil production has dropped to 1940s levels, necessitating imports of gasoline from allied countries like Iran. Major fuel shortages have forced thousands nationwide to stand in crowds in front of gas stations, even under a Chinese coronavirus lockdown, and have led to violence over the little gasoline available, with at least two deaths.\n\nPacheco stands accused of having uploaded a video to social media July 31 showing a Trujillo Fire Department ambulance stuck on the road. several men begin pushing it from behind to get it to a fuel source. The video shows the ambulance moving with the effort of multiple men as the large letters on its side reading \u201cRescue \u2014 Socialist Government of the State of Trujillo\u201d pass by glacially. One of the men pushing can be heard complaining, \u201ccome help push instead of standing there recording,\u201d to which two or three others respond and join the pushers.\n\nAnother unidentified voice can be heard saying, \u201cand the governor says there is no problem with the gasoline \u2014 look, the firefighters\u2019 rescue truck without gasoline!\u201d\n\nAccording to Espacio P\u00fablico, an NGO that operates in Venezuela, officials with the socialist regime\u2019s Scientific, Penal, and Criminal Investigations Body (CICPC) raided Pacheco\u2019s home Monday and arrested him. He is reportedly facing \u201cthree or four charges, among them \u2018terrorism\u2019 and \u2018incitement to hate.'\u201d\n\nDictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, having lost control of the National Assembly in the nation\u2019s last democratic elections in 2015, created an illegal parallel legislature known as the \u201cnational constituents\u2019 assembly\u201d in 2017 to pass laws favorable to the socialists. Among the first laws passed by the body, which consisted of Maduro allies such as his son and his wife, was the Law Against Hatred and Fascism, which allows Maduro\u2019s police to arrest anyone threatening \u201cpeaceful coexistence\u201d with the regime. The regime has used the law with increased frequency not just against prominent dissidents, but against anyone speaking out against the regime or exposing the realities of its failures in any way.\n\nThe fuel situation in Venezuela \u2014 a nation that, prior to socialism, was used to abundant and nearly free gasoline \u2014 has deteriorated significantly in the past year. Overall oil production fell to levels unseen since 1947 this June at 374,000 barrels per day, compared to the about 1.3 million barrels per day experts believe Venezuela\u2019s six largest oil refineries can produce. The steep decline occurred after the expropriation of PDVSA under Ch\u00e1vez, who replaced seasoned oil executives and engineers with socialist cronies who brought minimal talent and experience to the job.\n\nThe socialist government of the state of T\u00e1chira, the westernmost in the country and often the most aggressively anti-socialist, announced in late July that it would stop selling any gasoline at all \u2014 a shock to those in the state, who were told not that the move was necessary because of the well-documented shortages, but because of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe need to fuel vehicles has made enforcing the lockdowns difficult for Maduro\u2019s regime. Venezuelans have stood on long, tightly spaced lines for months to get minimal fuel rations, to buy food and, for the few that have steady employment, go to work. The tension on those lines has resulted in street fights and escalated violence, including at the hands of Maduro soldiers.\n\nMaduro\u2019s attorney general announced last week that police had arrested four soldiers and two civilians for killing Carlos Chaparro, a 47-year-old Venezuelan who was protesting the gasoline shortages when he was killed. Venezuela has seen exponential growth in police brutality in the last decade, particularly under Maduro. Police in the country killed thousands, most of them unarmed protesters, during the peak of the anti-socialist movement in 2014-2016. The violence particularly affects minors. Children as young as 11 have reported extensive torture at the hands of police. Police have shot to death at least two 14-year-olds in the past five years.\n\nTeens also face violence when seeking to refuel. In mid-July, similar to Chaparro\u2019s case, assailants killed an 18-year-old during a scuffle at a line for gasoline rations. The Maduro regime has not yet identified the culprits.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/latin-america/2020/08/04/venezuela-man-arrested-filming-socialist-ambulance-running-out-gas/", "published": "2020-08-04T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Caruzo: Venezuela\u2019s Socialists Stole a Supermarket and Gave It to Iran", "text": "CARACAS \u2013 The first Iranian supermarket in Venezuela has been generating buzz. Sold to us as a \u201ctake that, America\u201d joint venture between both \u201crebellious\u201d nations, it\u2019s further proof of the growing Iranian influence in what\u2019s left of this country.\n\nVenezuela is \u2013 as if we didn\u2019t have enough on our plate \u2013 becoming a gateway for the Islamic Republic to the region, courtesy of a regime desperate to do away with our resources and sovereignty so long as they get to rule over our ruined nation.\n\nMegasis (a name that, according to the people behind it, honors the fallen during the Iran-Iraq conflict that occurred in the \u201880s) opened its doors on Thursday, July 30th, in Venezuela. The face behind this venture is Issa Rezaei, a man who has ties to Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its missile program \u2014 I suppose that having the military control food distribution is something both regimes have in common.\n\nThe narratives by the regime\u2019s media machine, of course, have trumpeted this \u201ctriumph\u201d as much as possible, despite its reach hindered by no longer being able to latch onto DirecTV\u2019s infrastructure.\n\nThe creation of a \u201cNew World,\u201d the cooperation between Iran and Venezuela, breaking the U.S. sanctions, and the White House\u2019s \u201csupremacy\u201d are some of the components of the narrative expunged by our flamboyant vice president during the opening of this store.\n\nThe supermarket is located far from the more impoverished parts of the capital \u2013 in Terrazas del Avila, an area that, while belonging to the State of Miranda, is part of the Metropolitan Region of Caracas.\n\nFancy, clean, with high tech dystopian checkpoints for Chinese Coronavirus prevention (which don\u2019t seem to prevent their employees from getting infected), and, most importantly, stocked, it\u2019s almost too good to be true. The products display their price tags not in bolivars, but on the \u201cGreat Satan\u2019s\u201d greenbacks, the same U.S. dollars that were once illegal for us to hold and trade \u2013 for which we had to use clever wordsmithing, such as \u201cverdes\u201d (greens), \u201clechugas\u201d (lettuces), and even \u201cTrumps\u201d \u2013 that are now keeping whatever is left of our economy afloat.\n\nWhile the prices themselves are expressed in foreign currency, they do seem to be within range of other supermarkets in the country: $5.92 for Lacteos Los Andes\u2019 powdered milk (a company that was seized by the regime in 2008), $2.53 for a liter of corn oil, or $2.32 for a can of Iranian tomato paste. Some of the Iranian offerings are even cheaper than our Venezuelan counterparts \u2014 but in a country where the minimum wage isn\u2019t even $4 per month anymore, the products are out of reach for the majority.\n\nIt\u2019s not like you can simply walk in and purchase stuff on a whim either, thanks to the regime\u2019s authoritarian Chinese coronavirus measures. The governor of the State of Miranda, Hector Rodriguez, recently passed a new ruling that limits citizens from purchasing essential goods, only letting them do purchases on specific days of the week determined by the last number of our ID card \u2014 a nightmare from the worst years of the socialist collapse of Venezuela that has once again resurfaced.\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that the locale that this Iranian supermarket is occupying has a picturesque story of its own, tied to the ill-fated exploits of Venezuela\u2019s socialism.\n\nFor some time, the facilities used to belong to the Colombian \u201c\u00c9xito\u201d supermarket chains, and for a time, all was good. In the early days of 2010 (and at the apex of his socialist dream), the now Supreme and Eternal Commander of the Bolivarian Revolution Hugo Ch\u00e1vez decided to expropriate and seize \u00c9xito\u2019s entire chain and infrastructure to bring forth a Corporation of Socialist Markets (COMERSO), of which \u201cAbastos Bicentenario\u201d went onto occupying most of \u00c9xito\u2019s former locations.\n\nI think you can guess what happened next \u2014 it got run to the ground, trashed, obliterated. Shortages, long lines (some even overnight), misery, and all the wondrous experiences of grocery shopping in socialism. The last time I went to one of these was to accompany my mother. The experience was \u2014 depressing, to say the least.\n\nThe failure of Abastos Bicentenario was palliated by the Maduro regime through a new business: Tiendas CLAP \u2014 a tendril in the corrupt machinery of which Alex Saab (a man in the process of being extradited to the United States who some of the regime\u2019s diehard shills have tried to paint as a modern version of Oskar Schindler) is part of. The CLAP is Venezuela\u2019s socialist emergency aid kit system, in which true believers in the Bolivarian Revolution are rewarded with insect-infested rice, \u201cyellow\u201d milk, and rotten fish flesh.\n\nWith that also run to the ground, it\u2019s time for some Iranian \u201ccapitalism\u201d to come to the rescue.\n\nFor a regime that expropriated companies, seized land, and persecuted private entrepreneurship in the name of Socialist \u201cfood sovereignty\u201d to give it all away to Iran is not just baffling, but a testament to the failure of their misbegotten ideology.\n\nThe Iranian influence in our country grows \u2013 Iranian oil, military, and now food flood the country. This brand new supermarket has already been denounced as a front for money laundering \u2014 which wouldn\u2019t be too far-fetched if true, given the rise of bodegones (stores that sell imported goods without issue), despite the regime\u2019s U.S.-sanction related narratives stating otherwise. I personally don\u2019t see myself visiting these facilities anytime soon \u2013 not only are they a bit far from where I live (made worse by the limited transportation options due to coronavirus\u2019 quarantine and the severe gasoline shortages), but I would only be able to purchase anything on Mondays and Saturdays.\n\nNo halal meat for me, I guess.

In a company statement, Facebook said it would comply with the order to avoid risking criminal liability for employees in Brazil, but called the measure \u201cextreme\u201d and a \u201cthreat to freedom of expression\u201d outside of Brazil.\n\nThe statement read:\n\nFacebook complied with the order of blocking these accounts in Brazil by restricting the ability for the target Pages and Profiles to be seen from IP locations in Brazil. People from IP locations in Brazil were not capable of seeing these Pages and Profiles even if the targets had changed their IP location. This new legal order is extreme, posing a threat to freedom of expression outside of Brazil\u2019s jurisdiction and conflicting with laws and jurisdictions worldwide. Given the threat of criminal liability to a local employee, at this point we see no other alternative than complying with the decision by blocking the accounts globally, while we appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nLast Friday, Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes also ordered Facebook to pay a 1.92-million-real ($367,000) fine for \u201cnon-compliance\u201d with the initial order, adding that it would face additional daily fines of 100,000 reais ($19,000) if it did not remove the accounts worldwide.\n\nDe Moraes has become an unpopular figure among Bolsonaro supporters, many of whom accuse him of trying to usurp power from Bolsonaro.

Citing Germany\u2019s household-based tax, Lord Hall suggested the annual fee could be added to other bills like local government property taxes, so those without an interest in receiving the BBC\u2019s services wouldn\u2019t have a way to opt-out.\n\nBBC Licence Fee Could Be Replaced with Internet Tax https://t.co/VnYdD4cP1k \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 2, 2020\n\nLord Hall also said it was worth looking at a system where the amount paid \u2014 presently \u00a3157.50 a year \u2014 would scale depending on how wealthy the household was.\n\nDespite its long-held pretence of being a national broadcaster for all, the BBC has recently been struggling with public perception, juggling efforts to appeal to viewers with trying to appease minority political activists.\n\nOne of the clearest examples of this dichotomy of late is the BBC\u2019s handling of the Last Night of the Proms, an annual festival of classical music where traditional British patriotic songs are performed to a live audience.\n\nApparently bowing to pressure from Black Lives Matter UK, it was reported the BBC would scrap patriotic songs from the broadcast including Rule, Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory.\n\nIt later said the songs would be included, but performed without any words \u2014 a compromise that appears to have appeased or pleased no-one. Nevertheless, the furore around the decision has become a lightning-conductor for opinion in the United Kingdom, bringing left-wing figures out of the woodwork to express their displeasure at the kinds of people who enjoy patriotic music.\n\nLabour MP Neil Coyle caused outrage when he called Brexit-supporters \u201cabsolute sh*tbag racist w*nkers\u201d in relation to the row, and a BBC producer added to public concern when she compared the ordinary patriotism of Britons to the Nazi gas chambers.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson, for his part, has expressed his embarrassment over the whole affair.

Why are we concerned that we\u2019re playing into the hands of Donald Trump in this instance when we should be asking the more fundamental question, why are police doing this? And why are we in an environment where even the hint, the misinformation around police action, can lead to the spark of protest in this instance? In other words, we need to get to the heart of the matter. It\u2019s clear for Mike Pence and Donald Trump black people don\u2019t fall within the sphere of their moral concern.

You think that\u2019s all CNN is now \u2014 a troll channel. You think that\u2019s what that chyron is \u2014 a deliberate troll against the honesty and decency of everyday Americans. You think CNN gets its lulz that way.\n\nOh, no\u2026\n\nCNN isn\u2019t trolling anyone.\n\nWhat CNN is doing is revealing its true mindset.\n\nThat CNN chyron flashed on Wednesday. I saw it fly by on Twitter a gajillion times yesterday but assumed it was a joke, a deep fake.\n\nYou might think the only deep faker here is CNN, but that\u2019s unfair.\n\nCNN isn\u2019t lying or trolling\u2026\n\nWhen you keep in mind that CNN has spent most of the last decade devoting itself to endorsing, encouraging, normalizing, and fomenting political violence against its political enemies on the right, what we have at CNN is a mob so morally broken that in their diseased minds they honestly do see what\u2019s happening in Kenosha as \u201cmostly peaceful.\u201d\n\nStay with me here\u2026\n\nWhat I mean is, CNN is sincere in its belief that the level of violence in these Democrat-run cities, specifically Kenosha (for reasons I\u2019ll explain below) is too peaceful, and CNN finds that unsatisfactory and unacceptable.\n\nYou see, CNN doesn\u2019t want Kosovo in Kenosha. Fuck that. CNN wants Hiroshima. Especially in a traitorous place like Kenosha, a place that betrayed the cause and voted for Trump in 2016 \u2014 helped squeak the Orange Bad Man over the finish line in Wisconsin, which squeaked him right into the Oval Office.\n\nSee what I\u2019m getting at here\u2026?\n\nWhen you want to see the MAGAtards burn, all the MAGAtards, when you want to see them fed into a holocaust, Kenosha is mostly peaceful \u2014 and, man, how frustrating is that?\n\nYou do know the police are not the real targets in all this, right?\n\nYou have figured out by now that the police are only under fire because they are what stands in the way of the left\u2019s true targets \u2014 which is you and I; which is average, middle class Americans who just want to raise families, mow lawns, and live and let live.\n\nAlong with the Democrat Party and the terrorist groups who call themselves Black Lives Matter and Antifa, CNN wants us dead, wants our neighborhoods razed, our lives destroyed.\n\nWe\u2019re in the way of the terrorist revolution and the terrorist revolutionaries are done with this pussyfooting around. Violence? That\u2019s not violence. What you\u2019re seeing in Kenosha isn\u2019t peaceful. Wait till you see what violence really looks like.\n\nSo, yeah, in CNN\u2019s malignant mind, Kenosha is \u201cmostly peaceful,\u201d too goddamned peaceful, way too goddamned peaceful for these goddamned MAGAtards.\n\nBurn it all. Burn all of them.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.

I hear you. In times of peril, young people have stepped up and saved this country, abroad and at home. We held the line, scaled the cliffs, crossed oceans, liberated camps, and cracked codes. Yet today, political forces want to usher in the digital dark ages. A time of information without wisdom and tribalism without truth. National leaders on the left have normalized emotion-based voting and a radicalized identity politics that rejects Martin Luther King\u2019s dream. MLK\u2019s dream is our dream: for all Americans to be judged solely on their character. I say to Americans across the country, young and old: be a radical for freedom. Be a radical for liberty.\n\nGood stuff.\n\nAnd then it got better: with the help of two men and a walker, Cawthorn struggled to his feet and said, \u201cAnd be a radical for our Republic, for which I stand; one nation, under God, with liberty and justice for all.\u201d\n\nAlcindor, the stupidest and most bitter person in the media not named Chris Cuomo, was deeply triggered by the moment and heard one of those racial dog whistles the dogs in our media (sorry dogs!) only ever hear.\n\nUsing her verified Twitter account \u2014 and in an effort to sound, like, smart \u2014 she vomited up this wordy hunk of bile: \u201cMadison Cawthorn made it a point to stand, suggesting that all Americans to should stand during the pledge of allegiance & national anthem.

It\u2019s Wisconsin. It could have been a dozen other places in this country. The violence has been building unabated for three months now.\n\nEvery day, the mob becomes more radical. By some accounts, 30 Americans have died so far in these riots. Democrats have openly encouraged them. Republican leaders have been too fearful to stop them. Some have applauded at all.\n\nFive days into the first Minneapolis riots in May, as the city burned live on camera before everyone, former South Carolina Governor, Nikki Haley took to Twitter to support the rioters, quote: \u201cIt\u2019s important to understand that the death of George Floyd was personal and painful for many,\u201d Haley wrote, \u201d \u2026 in order to heal, it needs to be personal and painful for everyone.\u201d\n\nWell, Nikki Haley\u2019s wish came true. The riots have been personal and painful for this country, but not for Nikki Haley. She appears to be thriving.\n\nOn Monday, Haley spoke at a featured spot at the Republican National Convention, and the media hailed her as the future of conservatism. Of course, they did. They hate the Republican Party.\n\nA party that tolerates rioting has no future in a democracy. Human beings crave order. It\u2019s a prerequisite for life. They fear uncertainty, above all. People will trade virtually anything for relief from chaos. That\u2019s a fact of human nature. It\u2019s always true.\n\nAnd politicians who understand that win. Rudy Giuliani got elected twice in an overwhelmingly Democratic city because he knew that underneath it all, everyone hates lawlessness \u2014 everyone.\n\nRichard Nixon knew that, too. Nixon was not a charming man. No one ever longed to have a beer with him. Yet Nixon managed to win what is to this day the single biggest blowout in American history in the 1972 elections. How did he do that? It was simple.\n\nRichard Nixon was for order. His opponent was for chaos. It wasn\u2019t hard. It\u2019s not hard now.\n\nYet that lesson seems lost on this generation of leaders. Our cities are burning because the people in charge have allowed them to burn.\n\nTonight, the White House is sending hundreds of additional National Guardsmen and military policemen to Kenosha, and that is a very good thing.\n\nBut let\u2019s be honest, the Justice Department could have stopped all of this months ago. If Federal prosecutors had treated the organizers of BLM and Antifa the way they treated Roger Stone, our cities wouldn\u2019t look like Kosovo tonight.\n\nBut they didn\u2019t do that. Instead, they enforced standards selectively in direct violation of our most sacred American principle, which is equal protection under the law. They ignored that.\n\nAcross the country, prosecutors responded to politically disfavored crimes with maximum aggression, and they ignored the rest.\n\nJust this Sunday at a Catholic Cathedral in Philadelphia, a woman was brutally assaulted in the aisle, in the middle of a service. The attack was live-streamed to the entire congregation at home in real-time.\n\nThere was no question what happened. It was on videotape. And yet the authorities in Philadelphia concluded it was not a big deal. So they\u2019re not pressing charges. Here\u2019s the crime they\u2019ve decided to ignore.\n\n[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]\n\nCARLSON: It\u2019s awful, but think bigger for a moment. What is the effect on the country, on the rest of us, when authorities allow assaults like the one you just saw open threats and harassment and violence to go unpunished? What does that cause? Well, it increases tribalism for one thing. It makes us hate each other, and that\u2019s why they\u2019re doing it.\n\nOur leaders want us to believe that this is all a racial conflict. They\u2019re always telling us it is, but they\u2019re lying. It is not a racial conflict.\n\nAt its deepest level, the chaos they have unleashed has very little to do with race. Most Americans are not bigots. Unlike CNN, they are not fixated on skin color. They don\u2019t really care \u2014 most of them.\n\nWhat you\u2019re watching is more sinister than that. What you\u2019re watching is an effort by the academic left funded by big business to crush the last remaining resistance to their control of the country, and that resistance is an independent American middle class. That\u2019s who they really hate.\n\nThis is not a race war. This is a class war.

They drew guns on people outside their home on a sidewalk because they were Black. I mean, that\u2019s exactly what happened in that instance, and that is the message, I think, that Donald Trump wants to deliver to particularly white people \u2014 that he is the one standing between the lawlessness of Black and brown people. And he is the one that can essentially help white Americans maintain their status. He gets black people to sort of vouch for him and say that he\u2019s not a racist, and, in fact, say that America\u2019s not even really a racist country. So, listen, this could very well work because I think, you know, there is some anxiety among white Americans about the changing demographics of this country. There is some anxiety about sharing power with different groups in this country.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cYou have Donald Trump saying that \u2014 to white America, you won\u2019t have to share that power in his America. So I think, listen, he has been able to reinvent himself to white audiences throughout his career, particularly white evangelicals, who see him in some ways as a messianic kind of figure,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are white Americans who very much want to believe in Donald Trump, so they could very well believe in this version of Donald Trump that is presented here that is patently false and patently at odds with the Donald Trump we know and have seen over these last many years.\u201d\n\nHenderson added, \u201cYou saw all those Black men that are featured. There are no women. Black women, right? We talk about him going after women. He\u2019s really just going after white women. I don\u2019t think a single Black woman has stood live in the podium area at all. Maybe that will happen at some other point. But they are very, very consistently and strategically going after Black men and talking about some of the things that Joe Biden has said and done because there is a history of black men voting for Donald Trump, 13% did so in 2016. So it is that, and it is also this sort of indirect appeal to white moderates as well who want to feel comfortable voting for a man who is someone who is a racial flame thrower and likes to race bait.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/clips/2020/08/26/cnns-henderson-trumps-message-to-white-voters-is-you-wont-have-to-share-power-in-his-america/", "published": "2020-08-26T00:00:00"}, {"title": "CNN\u2019s Cooper Peddles Disproven Claim Trump Wanted to Inject People with Bleach", "text": "Wednesday, during CNN\u2019s coverage of the third night of the Republican National Convention, network host Anderson Cooper attempted to wrap a panel segment by making a quip about the possibility of President Donald Trump and bleach.\n\nThe notion, which has been deemed \u201cmostly false\u201d by left-leaning PolitiFact, is based on comments made by Trump promoting the idea of studying the use of disinfectants in the human body to mitigate the threat from the COVID-19 virus.\n\nThe comments, according to the White House, were taken out of context, and Trump never actually mention \u201cbleach\u201d in his remarks.\n\nCooper\u2019s remarks led to a back-and-forth with CNN contributor David Urban.\n\nPartial transcript as follows:\n\nCOOPER: If it were up to the President, though, we would have more deaths by experimenting on people with bleach, so, you know, I\u2019m not sure \u2014 (CROSSTALK) URBAN: No, boo, come on, Anderson.

Kaitlan, you\u2019re there at Fort McHenry. It\u2019s so sad and potentially dangerous to see a few hundred people who have gathered there, supporters of the president. They\u2019re very close together. They\u2019re not wearing masks, as Dana pointed out\u2014 in the midst of this very deadly coronavirus pandemic.

Tonight, we\u2019ve seen about 135 chairs before, and that\u2019s how many we counted were here. They seemed to all be filled. And what\u2019s notable is that the attendees are sitting pretty close to one another. They\u2019re not wearing masks. We spoke to at least four of them who had not been tested to coronavirus before coming to this event, Wolf, and it\u2019s unclear if some of them potentially were. We saw that was the case last night, which caused some confusion. The people seated around the president in the Rose Garden had been tested, according to the first lady\u2019s office, but several of the rows back, most of the attendees last night had not been tested.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s not clear if that\u2019s what the case is here,\u201d she continued. \u201cWhat you just saw after the vice president ended his speech, which I\u2019m not sure if you saw, but what we were watching is the president, and the first lady were down walking face-to-face, interacting with self of the audience members, many of whom are not wearing masks tonight, Wolf. It was striking to see how closely they were interacting, given we\u2019re not convinced every single person in the audience has been tested tonight. We were tested before we came in. Our photographers, producers were tested. It\u2019s not clear audience members were. We spoke to at least four of them who had not been. It was really striking to be here not only at this outdoor venue. You are seeing probably a bigger crowd than what many Americans have seen over the last several months, but also for the president and the first lady to come down from the stage and to be interacting with those other audience members not wearing masks tonight, Wolf.\u201d\n\nBlitzer said, \u201cYeah, I say begun, it looked very dangerous, very risky to me.

And our employees from prior seasons are also showing enthusiasm to return.\u201d\n\nThe successful hiring, however, is a problem for the business groups that are asking a judge to block Trump\u2019s job-saving, wage-generating executive order. A version of the lawsuit, filed July 17, says:\n\nThe [J-1] summer work/travel program has a cap of 109,000 vias per year. Employers who seek to hire summer students in the program, as well as employers seeking to hire interns and trainees, must certify that in doing so they \u201cwill not diplace U.S. workers at worksite where they will replace program participants.\u201d \u2026 There ceritfication requirements ensure that it is legally and practically impossible \u2026 for the J exchange programs to be responsible for the \u201cparticularly high\u201d unemployment rates for\u201dyoung Americans, who compete with certain J non-immigrant visa applicants.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit is getting a hearing before a D.C. judge on August 27.\n\nIn June, Blevins reported the ski industry\u2019s claims that their future was threatened by Trump\u2019s popular executive order barring the entry of foreign workers hired via the J-1, H-1B, and L-1 labor pipelines.\n\n\u201cIf you are an HR director at a ski area, you are panicking right now,\u201d Dave Byrd, the policy director for the 400-plus member National Ski Areas Association told Blevins in June, stating, \u201cJ-1s are not taking American jobs. We have tapped every single person in local communities who would be interested in taking short-term, temporary jobs. Without these workers, we are losing economic activity.\u201d\n\nFast-forward to August, and Blevins reported on one American coed, Mia Conley, who expected to attend Colorado State University this Fall:\n\nBut the graduate of Eagle Valley High School deferred her acceptance in July, after finding out all but one of her classes were going to be online. She\u2019s decided to get a job near home and attend Colorado Mountain College to complete college credits at a fraction of the cost. \u201cI thought about taking a gap year all through high school.

The programs keep roughly 2 million foreign contract-workers in an expanding variety of U.S. jobs, so minimizing CEOs\u2019 concerns about workforce turnover, domestic technology theft, worker quality, workplace civil-rights obligations, and escalating pay competition, which CEOs stigmatize as \u201cpoaching\u201d:\n\nExample #96: President Trump's low-immigration policies raise Americans' productivity.\n\nWSJ reports that meatpacking companies have secretly invested in robots since Trump reduced the supply of cheap labor.\n\n(This also means less $ for investors & Wall St)https://t.co/JTqZdW8lUI \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) July 11, 2020\n\n\u201cTo claim that ski resorts can\u2019t find Americans to work is laughable,\u201d especially because 30 million Americans are jobless, said Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies.

The solution is to not create that dependency.\n\nBut the Colorado Sun article shows again that executives can rebuild their American labor supply, Krikorian said.\n\nEmployers can actually try to hire Americans, including students and old people, for part-time work, he said. They can work with local schools and colleges to adjust schedules, and they can create staffing companies to help 20-something Americans move through several seasonal jobs around the nation, he said.\n\n\u201cSeasonal jobs might not be attractive for middle-aged men with kids and mortgages \u2014 but for young people who don\u2019t have mortgages and families, who are still figuring out what they want to do, they could be very attractive,\u201d he said.\n\nThese seasonal jobs are also good for society because they help teenagers become responsible adults, he said:\n\nIt is good for them to have the opportunity to earn money \u2026 but one of the most important things you need to learn as a youth is how to be an employee \u2014 not just the job skills, but how to work with the public, how to show up on time, and how not to lash out a crappy supervisor. If you\u2019re not working when you are young, you miss a chance to acquire those skills.\n\nDonald Trump's labor & immigration promises for a 2nd term are vague but useful.\n\nThey are also better for ordinary Americans than Joe Biden's business-backed, open-ended inflow of wage-cutting & rent-raising blue-collar workers & college-graduates. https://t.co/OmE4tRPf4T \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) August 26, 2020\n\nThe industry\u2019s preference for compliant, easy-to-manage, visa workers was outlined in a July 10 podcast by The Storm Skiing Journal. Byrd, who also serves as the chief advocated for the National Ski Areas Association, told the journal:\n\nWe\u2019re using summer work travel [workers]. And what that means is, these are college students. So, for the southern hemisphere, because their summer break in college aligns with our winter ski seasons, they\u2019re coming up to the U.S. to see how American businesses operate. \u2026 There\u2019s also an intern component, separate and apart from summer work travel [program]. That intern is a separate visa under the J-1 [program]. Those are specifically for college students who are going towards a career in hospitality in some fashion, and so they take internee positions. Deer Valley, for example, utilizes them very successfully. And it\u2019s a wonderful program. If you\u2019re in a hospitality major or lodging type of study program down in New Zealand or South Africa, South America, wherever, these internee programs in the U.S., because of our American business models, are so well-honed there, those are very great positions to get. \u2026 So, the resorts work with sponsoring agencies here in the U.S., who handle a lot of the recruiting, a lot of the regulatory process through the State Department. There are interviews. There are background checks. There\u2019s fingerprinting. They have to \u2014 as I mentioned \u2014 interview down at the embassies where they\u2019re coming from. If they\u2019re coming from, say, Romania or Poland, they\u2019re going to embassies over there. They provide their own travel [costs], but we do pay them the same wage-rate as American workers. The J-1s work with the ski areas is to find housing in the local community.\n\nThe ski groups are working with legislators to persuade the White House to lift the June 22 curbs, he said.\n\nWe\u2019re going to be working with the administration, with members of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, to help us advocate to the White House, to the State Department, to the Department of Labor, and Homeland Security. We\u2019re going to make a very strong economic argument, seeking a modification of the proclamation and within the proclamation itself \u2026 Specifically, we need both J-1s and H-2Bs, even at a time of higher unemployment because of COVID, [so we need] a modification that allows these people to be in-country by December 1. If you think about it, with so many ski areas impacted in March by the early closures, as an industry, we lost more than $2 billion for the 2020 year because of that early closure, missing out on Spring Break and Easter. We can\u2019t have that happen again for our winter and holiday season. I would estimate in that period of time between mid-December in the first week of January, you know it\u2019s a three-to-four week window, we make upwards of 20 to 25 percent of our revenue of the entire season during that window, and we have to be staffed appropriately.\n\nThirty million Americans have lost their jobs since China\u2019s coronavirus smashed up the U.S. economy:", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/08/27/donald-trumps-visa-curbs-get-americans-ski-resort-jobs/", "published": "2020-08-27T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Mayor Eric Garcetti Sticks with L.A.\u2019s \u2018Green New Deal\u2019 Despite California Blackouts", "text": "Mayor Eric Garcetti / Facebook\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said Wednesday evening that he was sticking with his version of the \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d for the city despite electricity blackouts elsewhere in the state due to the inadequacy of solar and wind power at peak demand.\n\nEarlier this year, Garcetti declared that L.A. would adopt a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d by abandoning plans to rebuild three natural gas plants, turning to solar and wind power instead.

The rule also denies work permits to migrants who apply for asylum after they are caught sneaking across the border by border officers, who have committed felonies or domestic violence in the United States, or who have been caught driving while drunk or high.\n\nElite-backed pro-migration groups have filed a lawsuit against the rule, which aids blue-collar Americans.\n\nThe rule was drafted after department officials discovered that many migrants were getting work permits in just 30 days, or 180 days, once they were caught and quickly released at the border \u2014 even though their asylum pleas would not be heard in court for more than a year.\n\nThe promise of near-immediate work permits encouraged hundreds of thousands of economic migrants to make the expensive journey to the United States because it allowed them to quickly get jobs and repay their travel debts to the cartel-affiliated coyotes. The legal jobs also allow the hard-working migrants to hire coyotes to place their children into the \u201cUnaccompanied Alien Children\u201d pipeline for delivery to their residencies in the United States.\n\nIn 2019, 439,000 asylum-seeking migrants got new or renewed work permits, said Jessica Vaughan, policy director at the Center for Immigration Studies.\n\n\u201cThis rule is going back to a tried-and-true policy regarding asylum seekers,\u201d said she said.\n\nPresident Bill Clinton\u2019s administration set the 180-day rule only to aid the few asylum seekers who were released when their asylum claims could not be quickly processed, she said. \u201cThe Clinton administration did not want to offer [quick] work permits as an incentive to make asylum claims,\u201d she said.\n\nBut the huge rush of migrants to the border in 2018 and 2019 overwhelmed detention spaces, forcing the release of many migrants, she said. \u201cTrump is reinstating a [no-incentive] principle that was adopted by the Clinton administration and was widely accepted as a sensible reform at the time.\u201d\n\nThe new rule was implemented following a routine two-month delay after it was first published in June. The rule says:\n\nThe proposed amendments would make asylum applicants eligible to apply for employment authorization 365 calendar days from the date their asylum application is received. The 365-day period was based on an average of the current processing times for asylum applications which can range anywhere from 6 months to over 2 years\n\nElite-backed pro-migration groups are suing to block Trump\u2019s rule, which helps American blue-collars get decent jobs at decent wages.\n\nThe board members of the two groups, the International Refugee Assistance Project and the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, include former top officials in President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, investment bankers, and prestigious lawyers.\n\nCBS reported on one of the groups\u2019 plaintiffs, who is a Central American migrant now living in Ohio:\n\nAs a single mother of two young children, including her nine-month-old U.S. citizen daughter, W.L. worries about her ability to support her family, particularly in the midst of a pandemic. The asylum-seeking mother, who says she was a victim of sexual violence in her native Guatemala, does not have a permit to work legally in the U.S., and under a new Trump administration rule taking effect Tuesday, she will not be able to apply for one for the next seven months. \u201cWe need work permits to cover our basic necessities, especially for our children,\u201d W.L., who asked for her initials to be used rather than her full name, told CBS News in Spanish.\n\nWealthy people gain economically and politically from the continued inflow of the legal and illegal workers, who also serve them as consumers and renters, and by expanding divisive diversity throughout Americans\u2019 society.\n\nIn contrast, the beneficiaries of Trump\u2019s DHS rule include tens of millions of blue-collar Americans who have faced growing job competition and wage loss from many millions of legal and illegal migrants. The migrants have also helped drive up Americans\u2019 housing prices, further disadvantaging white, black, and brown blue-collar families and their children.\n\nThe elites fund the pro-migration lawsuits because it \u201cstrikes their sense of social justice and their desire to help less-privileged people around the world, and because it feeds into the fantasy of what [they think] the U.S. asylum system is supposed to be doing,\u201d said Vaughan. She continued:\n\nThey\u2019re so insulated from reality that they don\u2019t understand the effects this has on Americans and legal immigrants. They see these asylum seekers as willing workers who can take service jobs and factory jobs and think there will be no consequences for Americans. They see this as a free lunch with no downsides \u2014 but they don\u2019t have to compete with [the asylum seekers for jobs, their [grown] children don\u2019t have to compete with them for jobs\u2026.. their children are not in the same schools.\n\nMoreover, Vaughan added, the work permit rules are needed to help legitimate asylum seekers: \u201cThis is necessary to avoid abuse of our asylum system, and the beneficiaries will be legitimate asylum seekers .. .who will not have to wait long to have their claims heard.\u201d\n\nTrump has been \u201cunstoppable\u201d in trying to block the flow of migrants across the U.S. border, admitted Miles Taylor, a former DHS official who is organizing former officials to oppose Trump\u2019s reelection. During an August 25 podcast report in theDailyBeast.com, Taylor said:\n\nI\u2019d actually just become the Deputy Chief of Staff [in 2018] and so before that I\u2019ve been [Chief of Staff] John Kelly\u2019s national security adviser, and so had been doing nothing immigration and was glad not to be doing immigration, because everyone who was doing immigration was just suffering daily at the President\u2019s unstoppable obsession with building the wall and blocking caravans.\n\nTrump\u2019s border security policy helped push up wages for blue-collar Americans at a faster rate than white-collar wages. However, it still leaves millions of illegal migrants in the United States.\n\nTrump\u2019 focus on immigration makes sense, in part, because it is very popular and he can expand his vote total by expanding the turnout of non-college voters \u2014 including working-class blacks \u2014 in battleground states:\n\nIt's clear where Trump sees opportunity to offset erosion in support since '16: amping up turnout among his base \u2013 non-college whites. And by my math, non-college whites were a disproportionate share of '16 *non-voters* in all '20 battlegrounds except AZ and TX. pic.twitter.com/1JB3uDPi2l \u2014 Dave Wasserman (@Redistrict) August 26, 2020\n\nSince June 2020, Trump also has begun to trim the huge inflow of white-collar visa workers who take jobs from huge numbers of U.S. college graduates. That is a late and incomplete response to his March 2016 promise: \u201cI will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and immigration program. No exceptions.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign is promising a nationwide amnesty for illegal immigrants, rapid increases in legal immigration, and a dramatic jump in refugee settlement. Biden also promises a temporary halt to border enforcement, the inflow of more visa workers, plus a green card giveaway to many temporary visa workers who already have taken jobs from American graduates.\n\nEach year, roughly four million Americans turn 18 and begin looking for jobs and wages.\n\nBut the federal government helps CEO s and investors by inflating the labor supply with roughly one million new legal immigrants, and by allowing companies to keep roughly two million blue-collar and white-collar visas workers in jobs needed by Americans.\n\nThe labor force inflation is worsened by the resident population of at least eight million illegal migrant workers, and by the arrival of many new illegal migrants and so-called \u201coverstay\u201d people who do not leave the United States when their visas expire.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/economy/2020/08/26/dhs-sets-1-year-delay-of-work-permits-to-asylum-migrants/", "published": "2020-08-26T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Yelp CEO: When Google Competes on a Level Playing Field, It Loses", "text": "The CEO of the popular restaurant review app Yelp, Jeremy Stoppelman, appeared on a podcast recently to discuss the growing monopoly power of the Big Tech Masters of the Universe. According to Stoppelman, Google doesn\u2019t like to compete on a level playing field because, \u201cwhen they tried to, they were losing.\u201d\n\nAppearing on a recent episode of The Vergecast, Jeremy Stoppelman the CEO of the popular restaurant and business review app Yelp discussed antitrust issues surrounding major tech firms such as Amazon, Apple, and Google.\n\nSToppelman has been a vocal critic of Google for years, noting the company\u2019s dominance of areas such as maps, local search, and reviews. Stoppelman discussed his antitrust investigation of Google on the podcast stating: \u201cI\u2019ve been working on it for over a decade and it\u2019s great to see that more people have jumped on board. When we started out criticizing Google and highlighting some of their abuses, we got \u2014 especially from Silicon Valley \u2014 so many eye rolls.\u201d\n\nDuring the podcast, Verge reporter Nilay Patel asked Stoppelman if he believes that Google should not be allowed TO enter local search or be allowed to enter a category where they have a large enough dataset to deliver results immediately. Stoppelman discussed how he believes Google has acted in an anti-competitive way towards his company, stating:\n\nCertainly they can compete, but they should compete on a level playing field. And in fact, when they tried to, they were losing. There are conversations that are now public that were over email, where they\u2019re like, \u201cOh yeah, Yelp is coming up so much. We have to do something. Okay. Whenever Yelp is going to show high-end results, we should trigger our map box and make sure that our results are above it.\u201d They literally had an \u201cif\u201d statement in their code that said, \u201cIf Yelp, then show us our stuff above it.\u201d If you occupy a monopoly position, you should not be able to basically jam everybody off the page just because you want that revenue to yourself. You built up this trust with consumers, they all learned to rely on you. You bought up all the search box market share so anyone that types in a search \u2014 whether it\u2019s Safari or Firefox \u2014 is going straight to your site and then you\u2019re burying objectively better content. I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s not playing the game fairly.\n\nWhen asked how he believes that the online search marketplace could be made more equal, Stoppelman stated:\n\nI think you ideally make it so that Google can\u2019t take all of the lucrative areas that it doesn\u2019t currently occupy, and then jam a product into that space and then absorb all of the market share. Look at what they did at travel search. They went and they bought a critical component of travel search, which is this company, ITA, that had all of the data on where the flights are coming and going and how much they cost and so forth that all of the major players relied on. And they did a little, \u201cOh yeah, we\u2019re definitely not going to use it for nefarious purposes.\u201d And now if you do a travel search or airline search, all of a sudden, instead of seeing all the major players for airline search, you\u2019re getting a Google box, which doesn\u2019t necessarily cover all the best flights, all the best prices \u2014 there\u2019s been some studies on that.

Swartz notes that as gaming grows more important for many Americans during the pandemic, it has highlighted the power that Google and Apple have over the billion-dollar industry.\n\nSwartz writes:\n\nEpic Games Inc.\u2019s lawsuits against the online stores of Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google for punitive business practices associated with 30% fees could for the first time shine the anticompetitive light on so-called network-effects platforms that exhibit the deep reservoirs of power that tech\u2019s largest companies wield, say gaming developers and experts in the field.\n\nJames Currier, managing partner at NFX, a Silicon-Valley-based venture capital firm, told MarketWatch: \u201cThis is an inflection point, and the start of a long-running debate on how these platforms push us right to the edge of what we are willing to pay.\u201d Currier added: \u201cThese closed gardens feel like extortion.

CEO Jensen Huang commented during an earnings call on Wednesday:\n\nThe gaming industry, with all that\u2019s happening around the world, and it\u2019s really unfortunate, but it\u2019s made gaming the largest entertainment medium in the world. The thing that people haven\u2019t realized about videogames is that it\u2019s not just a game itself anymore. You\u2019re spending time with your friends. You\u2019re using it to create, to realize your imaginations. People are using it for broadcast, for sharing ideas and techniques with other people, and then of course it\u2019s just an incredibly fun way to spend time.\n\nSwartz concludes:\n\nWith gaming industry profits at record levels, the decision on how they\u2019re doled out has never been more important. Apple and Google, for example, are in danger of losing one of their most profitable titles, \u201cFortnite,\u201d as they face greater antitrust scrutiny from legislators. (\u201cFortnite\u201d hauled in $1 billion in player spending on Apple iOS devices through mid-May, based on estimates from mobile-app research company Sensor Tower, suggesting Apple received hundreds of millions of dollars from the hit videogame.)\n\nRead more at MarketWatch here.\n\nLucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

This is an injustice that cries out to heaven!\u201d he said.\n\nThe pope went on to suggest that such unequal economic growth is the fruit of greed and demands rectification.\n\n\u201cWhen the obsession to possess and dominate excludes millions of persons from having primary goods,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen economic and technological inequality are such that the social fabric is torn; and when dependence on unlimited material progress threatens our common home, then we cannot stand by and watch.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear from the pope\u2019s words how he believes equal economic growth among nations and individuals should be achieved, or whether it is merely a question of redistribution of all the world\u2019s wealth equally among individuals.\n\nCatholic social teaching has, however, consistently recognized the natural differences among persons and nations and insisted that economic homogeneity is an unworkable utopia.\n\nIn the first \u201csocial encyclical,\u201d Pope Leo XIII\u2019s 1891 text Rerum Novarum, the pontiff called for a healthy realism, bearing with \u201cthe condition of things inherent in human affairs\u201d for \u201cit is impossible to reduce civil society to one dead level,\u201d as opposed to the Socialists\u2019 utopian efforts toward perfect economic equality, since \u201call striving against nature is in vain.\u201d\n\nLeo called to mind that manifold differences naturally exist among persons: \u201cpeople differ in capacity, skill, health, strength; and unequal fortune is a necessary result of unequal condition.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Leo insisted that these natural inequalities are not necessarily evil, either for individuals or for the larger community. In fact, he wrote, social and public life \u201ccan only be maintained by means of various kinds of capacity for business and the playing of many parts; and each man, as a rule, chooses the part which suits his own peculiar domestic condition.\u201d\n\nWhile the Catholic Church teaches that there are, indeed, \u201csinful inequalities that affect millions of men and women,\u201d which stand \u201cin open contradiction of the Gospel,\u201d it also recognizes that not all inequalities are evil and the campaign to impose perfect economic equality would cause more harm than it would alleviate.\n\nFollow @tdwilliamsrome", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/economy/2020/08/26/pope-francis-unequal-wealth-means-the-economy-is-sick/", "published": "2020-08-26T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Munro: Donald Trump Holds Idealistic Naturalization Ceremony at RNC", "text": "Five legal immigrants swore loyalty to the United States during the second night of the GOP convention, giving President Donald Trump an opportunity to tout the incalculable value of U.S. citizenship and to emphasize the new immigrants\u2019 duties to other Americans.\n\n\u201cWith the rights and freedoms each of you now enjoys as citizens, there is no dream beyond your wildest reach, because Americans can do anything,\u201d Trump said after the brief naturalization ceremony. Trump then emphasized the immigrants\u2019 moral and legal obligations to other Americans, saying:\n\nToday, you have also accepted the profound duties and responsibilities that come with American citizenship. By swearing the oath of allegiance, each of you has entered a sacred and unbreakable covenant with our nation. You have pledged your undying loyalty to the American people, the American Constitution, and the American way of life.

Most have been living in the United States for several years, legally, because they were earlier awarded green cards.\n\nThe migrants also allowed Trump to emphasize the contributions of skilled migrants, such as medical skills. Trump has repeatedly said he wants to shift immigration rules to favor skilled migrants, instead of migrants who have family ties to prior immigrants.\n\nIn reality, most migrants arrive with very limited cultural or workplace skills, or else they get their initial green card from Fortune 500 companies in exchange for taking jobs from Americans.\n\nDemocrat candidate Joe Biden\u2019s immigration policy promises to dramatically increase the inflow of unskilled migrants to employers, retailers, and real-estate companies.\n\nHe promises a nationwide amnesty for illegal immigrants, rapid increases in legal immigration, and a dramatic jump in refugee settlement. Democrats also promise a temporary halt to border enforcement, the inflow of more visa workers, plus a green card giveaway to many temporary visa workers who already have taken jobs from American graduates.\n\nIn contrast, Trump has promised to exclude migrants who depend on government welfare and to bar companies from using foreign workers to replace Americans.\n\nThe oath sworn by the new immigrants reflected the United States\u2019 centuries-long history of immigration, including the long period of low immigration from the 1920s to the 1970s:\n\nI hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; that I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform noncombatant service in the Armed Forces of the United States when required by the law; that I will perform work of national importance under civilian direction when required by the law; and that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; so help me God.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/economy/2020/08/25/donald-trump-holds-idealistic-naturalization-ceremony-at-convention/", "published": "2020-08-25T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Ohio Trucker: Only Trump Could Have Saved Lordstown Auto Jobs", "text": "Geno DiFabio, a trucker in Lordstown, Ohio, says only President Trump could have brokered a deal to keep auto jobs in his community after General Motors (GM) idled their plant.\n\n\u201cGeno is a truck driver from Ohio, who heard politicians for years make empty promises about defending American jobs, only to see those promises broken again and again,\u201d Vice President Mike Pence said in a video montage during the second evening of the Republican National Convention (RNC). He continued:\n\nIn 2019, when General Motors closed its plant in Lordstown, Ohio. President Donald Trump refused to stand by and watch it happen. And as Geno observed, this president reached out to General Motors to find a way to bring jobs back to Lordstown.

Economists have said GM\u2019s idling in Lordstown will eventually result in the layoff of about 8,000 American workers in supporting industries.\n\nWith pressure from Trump, GM sold the plant to Lordstown Motors, a cutting-edge electric vehicle company, which is now vowing to hire about 600 Americans next year to help produce its first round of 20,000 all-electric pickup trucks known as the Endurance.\n\nIn 2022, Lordstown Motors expects to hire more workers to produce a line of all-electric SUVs and pickup trucks.\n\nAfter its initial hiring of about 600 Americans, executives hope to hire an additional 4,000 to 5,000 for the plant as early as 2022 to produce other all-electric vehicles based on demand.\n\nLikewise, GM broke ground on construction for a new factory in Lordstown that will produce battery cells and packs.\n\nAmerican manufacturing is vital to the U.S. economy, as every manufacturing job supports an additional 7.4 American jobs in other industries. Decades of free trade have eliminated five million manufacturing jobs from the American economy and resulted in the closure of about 50,000 manufacturing plants.\n\nJohn Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

In the last few years, specifically as a result of Trump\u2019s 25 percent tariffs on foreign steel, brought an employment boom and economic stability to Minnesota\u2019s Iron Range communities.\n\n\u201c[China] \u2014 and other supposed trade partners \u2014 dumped steel into our markets and slapped tariffs on us, tipping the scales in their favor.

We lost a generation of young people who had to move out of the area to find a livelihood.\u201d\n\n\u201cFour years later, I am happy to say that after decades of despair, the Iron Range is roaring back to life and we have one man to thank: President Donald Trump,\u201d Vlaisaljevich said.\n\n\u201cHe has made good on all of his campaign promises, and then some. He has fought to give us a fair chance to compete. He has become the \u2018champion of working Americans,'\u201d a blue-collar billionaire.\n\nThe Iron Range\u2019s comeback, thanks to Trump\u2019s agenda, has been well-documented over the last few years.\n\nIn March of last year, the Star Tribune reported:\n\nMines and logging companies are hiring, small businesses are expanding and Minnesota\u2019s Iron Range is bouncing back from the mine and production facility closures that hit hard just a few years ago. [Emphasis added] \u2026 \u201cA 5.2 percent increase in employment means a lot of money in the economy in northeastern Minnesota,\u201d said Kelsey Johnson, president of the Iron Mining Association of Minnesota. \u201cIt means that families are able to pay for their necessities and have a little bit of savings at home as well.\u201d [Emphasis added] \u2026 Iron ore exports were up 42 percent in the third quarter of 2018 compared to the previous year, the forecast states. [Emphasis added]\n\nIn October 2018, Breitbart News reported how American steel workers in the Iron Range were able to secure a wage boost thanks to the president\u2019s agenda:\n\nThe 1,850 American steelworkers who are set to see wage increases are based in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan\u2019s Tilden and Empire mines and the United Taconite and Hibbing Taconite mines in Iron Range, Minnesota. [Emphasis added]\n\nTrump\u2019s agenda has also helped bring supporting industries back to the Iron Range, as the Star Tribune reported in July 2018:\n\nBailey and his wife, Tracy, bought the shuttered Courtyard Cafe on historic Howard Street. In December, they received some splashy company when the large BoomTown Brewery & Woodfire Grill opened a block up the road. Not far away, cranes and cement trucks are cranking out factory additions at the pipemaker Iracore International, the truck cooling-system maker L&M Radiator and the custom manufacturer Range Steel Fabricators. \u2026 The level of activity has surprised some locals, but the reason behind it is clear: The iron ore companies are healthy again.

(AP) \u2014 A person with knowledge of the situation says NBA players decided Thursday that they want to continue the season, coming to that consensus one day after three postseason games were postponed in a protest of racial injustice.\n\nIt was not clear yet when the season would resume, according to the person who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because neither the league nor the National Basketball Players Association had announced anything publicly.\n\nThe NBA\u2019s board of governors were meeting separately Thursday to decide next steps. There were three games on Thursday\u2019s schedule, and the league did not immediately say if they would be pushed back. But with the players exiting their meeting around noon, and the first game of the tripleheader scheduled to begin at 4 p.m. Eastern, it seemed most unlikely that the day\u2019s slate would not be disrupted.\n\nOne potential remedy for the schedule, the person said, was to play the three games that were postponed Wednesday on Friday, and the three games scheduled for Thursday on Saturday, though that had not been decided.\n\nStarting with the Milwaukee Bucks, who refused to take the court for their game Wednesday against the Orlando Magic, players from six teams made the extraordinary decisions to protest the shooting by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin on Sunday of Jacob Blake, a Black man, apparently in the back while three of his children looked on.\n\nKenosha is about 40 miles south of Milwaukee.\n\nNBA players didn\u2019t come to Disney solely for a restart to their season. They also wanted social reform, as did other sports leagues \u2014 many of which followed the NBA\u2019s lead Wednesday by calling off games. Some NFL teams did the same Thursday, choosing not to practice.\n\nIt followed a similar pattern as what happened in March: The NBA was the first league to shut down because of the coronavirus pandemic, and other sports followed then as well.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing that we all understand is if we\u2019re not playing, what are we doing? What are we doing to show and to help what\u2019s going on outside this bubble?\u201d Boston Celtics forward Grant Williams said, shortly before the Bucks were scheduled to tip off their game against the Magic.\n\nInstead, the Bucks players remained in the locker room, finally emerging hours later to read a statement demanding action from lawmakers and encouraging voting by citizens.\n\nThey changed the narrative across the entire sports landscape, putting the focus squarely on social justice reform in protest of the shooting of Blake.\n\nWhile players and teams from baseball, the WNBA and MLS sat out their competitions Wednesday night, NBA players and coaches met for nearly three hours in a Disney hotel to determine next steps, including whether the season should continue. They did not come to a consensus, a person with knowledge of the meeting told AP on condition of anonymity because details weren\u2019t revealed publicly.\n\nMore talks took place in the early hours of Thursday, followed by the player meeting that morning to decide to continue the season.\n\nThe Western & Southern Open won\u2019t be played Thursday, with the U.S. Tennis Association, along with the ATP and WTA Tours, announcing play would be paused after two-time Grand Slam women\u2019s champion Naomi Osaka had already said she wouldn\u2019t play her semifinal match.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t expect anything drastic to happen with me not playing, but if I can get a conversation started in a majority white sport I consider that a step in the right direction,\u201d Osaka tweeted. \u201cWatching the continued genocide of Black people at the hand of the police is honestly making me sick to my stomach.\u201d\n\nBefore coming to Disney, many NBA players wrestled for weeks about whether it was even right to play, fearing that a return to games would take attention off the deaths of, among others, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd in recent months.\n\nThey ultimately decided coming to the bubble and playing televised games would give them the largest platform, though now at least some are wondering if that\u2019s still true.\n\nIt appears now they will find out if that\u2019s the case.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/sports/2020/08/27/nba-players-decide-to-continue-season-pursue-other-social-justice-initiatives/", "published": "2020-08-27T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Several NFL Teams Cancel Practices in Wake of Jacob Blake Shooting", "text": "Several NFL teams canceled practices on Thursday to focus instead on social activism in the wake of the officer-involved shooting of Jacob Blake.\n\nOne of the first to cancel its practice was the Washington Football Team, according to TMZ Sports.\n\nTeam head coach Ron Rivera insisted that he and team president Jason Wright made the decision to cancel the practice together.\n\n\u201cJason Wright and I worked this afternoon to develop a response that has the right balance between the business of football and being truly thoughtful about the social injustice we witnessed with this latest incident in Wisconsin,\u201d Rivera reportedly said on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe went to Mr. Snyder with our plan for tomorrow and we were given his complete support and approval,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cIn place of our practice at FedEx Field,\u201d Rivera exclaimed, \u201cthe players, coaches and football staff will meet as a football family and we will continue our open dialogue on the issues of racism and social injustice in our country.\u201d\n\nOn the heels of the Washington Team\u2019s decision, the New York Jets, Indianapolis Colts, Tennessee Titans, and Arizona Cardinals joined the Washington team in canceling their practices.\n\nThe Packers, Jaguars, and Bears postponed the start of their practices, but did not cancel them entirely.\n\nOn the other hand, the Ravens, the Giants, Patriots, and the Buccaneers went ahead with their practices as scheduled.\n\nWe have cancelled all team activities today.

Proud of you\u201d and in a separate tweet added, #Proud of all the sports teams and athletes taking a stand tonight #BLM\u201d\n\nAfter reaching the semifinals late Wednesday, Milos Raonic said the ATP and WTA should consider a joint action that goes beyond a small group of players.\n\n\u201cI think real disruption, that\u2019s what makes change, and I think a lot of real disruption is caused by affecting people in a monetary way and can force some kind of change,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping at least we on the men\u2019s tour as well as the women\u2019s, we band together and we show support.\u201d\n\nAll NBA and WNBA games, three Major League Baseball games and five of six Major League Soccer games were called off Wednesday as athletes demanded racial justice.\n\nOsaka beat No. 12 Anett Kontaveit 4-6, 6-2, 7-5 on Wednesday afternoon, reaching the semifinals as the only Top 10 player left in the bracket. Late Wednesday, she was still scheduled to play No. 14 Elise Mertens in the semifinals.\n\nVictoria Azarenka will play eighth-seeded Johanna Konta in the other women\u2019s semifinal. Konta beat Maria Sakkari 6-4, 6-3, and Azarenka advanced in straight sets against Ons Jabeur.\n\nAzarenka, who was No. 1 in 2012, acknowledged Wednesday that she had considered retiring at the start of the year. She\u2019s currently No. 59 but has reached her first semifinal since April 2019.\n\n\u201cIn January, I didn\u2019t know if I was going to play at all,\u201d she said. \u201cSo end of January, I decided: You know what? I might try, last time, and see what happens.\u201d\n\nIn the men\u2019s bracket, top-ranked Novak Djokovic had no problems with his creaky neck or the swirling winds during a 6-3, 6-1 victory over Jan-Lennard Struff that was by far his best showing of the week.\n\nSo far, no rust at all after the long layoff from competitive tennis.\n\n\u201cEverything was worked on in the last six months, I had plenty of time,\u201d Djokovic said. \u201cI worked on every single thing. It\u2019s great it\u2019s paying off so early after the break.\u201d\n\nDjokovic tested positive for COVID-19 after exhibition matches he organized in Serbia and Croatia in June with no social distancing.\n\nIn his match Monday against Ricardas Berankis, Djokovic had his sore neck massaged twice by a trainer during a 7-6 (2), 6-4 victory that included seven double faults. The neck has gotten better, and so has his overall game.\n\n\u201cRight now it\u2019s not a concern,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s still not 100% but it\u2019s close to that. I\u2019ve been gaining more range in my movement of the neck every single day, so no complaints.\u201d\n\nIn the semifinals, he\u2019ll face Roberto Bautista Agut, who knocked out defending champion Daniil Medvedev earlier in the day.\n\nMedvedev failed to close it out in the second set, and Bautista Agut rallied for a 1-6, 6-4, 6-3 victory that eliminated yet another top player out of the tune-up tournament for the U.S. Open. Djokovic is the only player left in the tournament with an ATP Masters 1000 title to his credit.\n\nMedvedev led 4-3 in the second before letting it slip away. He converted only five of 20 break points in the match and swatted his racket against the court in frustration at the end.\n\n\u201cEven in the third set I had my chances and didn\u2019t take them,\u201d Medvedev said.\n\nBautista Agut reached his third Masters semfinal and his first since 2016. He needed a set to adjust to the breezy, cooler conditions on court.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never easy to come back and play good at first,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to be patient, to try to enjoy every single match I play here after six months without competing. Just pleased and happy to be in the semifinals.\u201d\n\nMedvedev hoisted the champion\u2019s Rookwood Pottery cup last year in Mason, Ohio, where the tournament is held annually. This year\u2019s event was moved to the U.S. Open site in Flushing Meadows because of pandemic precautions, creating a two-tournament event without spectators.\n\nFourth-seeded Stefanos Tsitsipas also advanced to the semifinals when Reilly Opelka withdrew during the first set of their match Wednesday after getting treatment for an injured right knee. He\u2019ll face Raonic, who beat Filip Krajinovic 4-6, 7-6 (2), 7-5.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/sports/2020/08/26/osaka-withdraws-in-protest-ws-put-on-hold-thursday/", "published": "2020-08-26T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Joe Biden Praises NBA Boycott: \u2018Now Is Not the Time for Silence\u2019", "text": "Former Vice President Joe Biden is throwing his support behind the budding NBA boycott over Jacob Blake\u2019s shooting by police, arguing that \u201cnow is not the time for silence.\u201d\n\nBiden, the presumptive Democrat nominee, took to social media shortly after the Milwaukee Bucks opted to boycott the fifth game of the Eastern Conference playoffs.

So it\u2019s natural that people would try to bring down those symbols.\u201d\n\nIn their Vanity Fair conversation, Davis told DuVernay that the Black Lives Matter riots and \u201cdefund the police\u201d movement represent the culmination of decades of radical left-wing activism.\n\n\u201cThe protests offered people an opportunity to join in this collective demand to bring about deep change, radical change,\u201d Davis said. \u201cDefund the police, abolish policing as we know it now. These are the same arguments that we\u2019ve been making for such a long time about the prison system and the whole criminal justice system. It was as if all of these decades of work by so many people, who received no credit at all, came to fruition.\u201d\n\nAngela Davis also equated capitalism with racism. \u201cCapitalism has always been racial capitalism,\u201d she told DuVernay. \u201cWherever we see capitalism, we see the influence and the exploitation of racism.\u201d\n\nShe also pushed for free healthcare and childcare as a way of redressing racism. \u201cNot only should there be free education, but there should be free childcare and there should be free health care as well. All of these issues are coming to a head. This is, as you said, a racial reckoning. A reexamination of the role that racism has played in the creation of the United States of America.\u201d\n\nAva DuVernay acknowledged in a tweet that the editor of her interview with Davis was Ta-Nehisi Coates, the author and journalist whose 2014 Atlantic article \u201cThe Case for Reparations\u201d reignited the push for slavery reparations.\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg.

Yes, I\u2019m also very proud Britain ended slavery in the 19th Century, but this song is not about that.\u201d\n\nAgain Ms Lewis\u2019 myopic view of British history was dispelled by Daubney, who noted that: \u201cFor 300 years Barbary Pirates from North Africa frequently plundered our shores for slaves.

That followed Ankara\u2019s deployment of a seismic research vessel to prospect for potential oil and gas reserves in waters that Athens claims are located over Greece\u2019s continental shelf.\n\nCyprus and Greece are EU members, while Turkey is not. Josep Borrell, the 27-nation bloc\u2019s foreign policy chief, tweeted after the end of the talks: \u201cEastern Med: Full solidarity (with) Greece&Cyprus. Calling for immediate de-escalation by Turkey and reengaging in dialogue.\u201d\n\nGreek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias, who also met in Vienna with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, said he was \u201cpleased\u201d with the solidarity expressed by his country\u2019s EU partners and their \u201ccondemnation of Turkey\u2019s illegal behaviour.\u201d\n\n\u201cTurkey is the only (party) responsible for the escalation of tension in the eastern Mediterranean, and it must immediately leave the Greek continental shelf,\u201d Dendias said after Friday\u2019s talks. \u201cThat is a necessary precondition for de-escalation.\u201d\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey would press ahead with its prospecting until Aug. 23 as planned. But following a phone call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, he signalled that Ankara and Berlin had agreed to a \u201csoftening\u201d of positions after that date.\n\nThere was no indication from Athens whether it had been consulted, or had agreed, on the matter. Merkel had interceded to defuse a similar face-off between Greece and Turkey a few weeks ago.\n\nErdogan also warned that Turkey would strongly respond to any \u201charassment\u201d of its vessels by Greece.\n\nDendias said Greece was open to talks with Turkey, \u201cbut obviously not while subject to pressure and blackmail.\u201d\n\nRelations between the historic regional rivals \u2014 and nominal NATO allies \u2014 have hit a more than two-decade low over the prospecting mission launched Monday.\n\nGreece placed its armed forces on high alert and sent warships to the spot, demanding the vessels\u2019 withdrawal. Turkey claims it has every right to prospect in the area, as well as in neighbouring waters Cyprus considers its own, after the discovery of large offshore gas deposits in recent years off Israel, Egypt and Cyprus.\n\nWith the warships dancing about each other in a relatively small patch of sea, there\u2019s a real danger of rapid escalation in the case of an accidental collision or hostile act.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, said before the talks that \u201cthe provocations\u201d that are happening in the eastern Mediterranean \u201ccan\u2019t continue.\u201d\n\n\u201cNor can the Turkish drilling,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are working toward a direct dialogue between the parties that would contribute to finding a solution for this issue.\u201d Maas added that there should be no drilling during any negotiations.\n\nApart from backing from its EU partners, Athens is also seeking a commitment for potential EU sanctions against Turkey. Dendias said a list of possible sanctions is being drafted and will be discussed at the next foreign ministers\u2019 meeting in Berlin later this month.\n\nIn a strong show of support this week, France pledged to boost its military presence in the eastern Mediterranean and sent two warships to the area Thursday for joint drills with the Greek navy. France also deployed two fighter planes to Crete.\n\nFrench relations with Turkey, which is not an EU member, are already bad over Ankara\u2019s involvement in Libya\u2019s civil war.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron tweeted Friday that he spoke to U.S. President Donald Trump about the situation in the eastern Mediterranean, Libya and Lebanon.\n\n\u201cWe share the same views.

As the total number of people who had been on board was not known, the search and rescue operation continued into Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe coast guard described the effort as \u201cone of the largest and most successful search and rescue operations to have taken place in the Aegean Sea,\u201d noting that it took place mainly at night and that many of those rescued, including many children, had not been wearing life jackets.\n\nOf those rescued, 72 were transported to Rhodes, five to the island of Karpathos and 19 were picked up from a cargo ship by the Turkish coast guard. Those taken to the Greek islands were being given coronavirus tests and were being housed in quarantine hotels.\n\nThree of those rescued were arrested as suspected migrant smugglers, the coast guard said.\n\nAuthorities were alerted after a passenger on board the yacht made an emergency call late Tuesday.\n\nThey scrambled helicopters, naval and coast guard vessels, and several passing merchant ships also participated in the operation.\n\nBut Greece\u2019s coast guard said its rescue efforts were hampered by the Turkish coast guard. The incident comes during a crisis in Greek-Turkish relations, with the two neighbors in an acrimonious dispute over maritime exploration rights in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nThe coast guard said in a statement that two Turkish patrol vessels arrived in the search and rescue area during the overnight operation, after a \u201clarge number\u201d of people had already been rescued.\n\nThe statement said the Turkish vessels did not notify the rescue operation coordinator about their presence and made no essential contribution to the effort. \u201cAlso, they were constantly calling on the nearby ships in the area to depart,\u201d it said.\n\nThe Greek coast guard statement added that the Turkish patrol boats took 19 of the rescued migrants off a Maltese-flagged, Turkish-owned cargo ship that had picked them up, thereby hampering efforts to account for the number of rescued and determine whether there were people missing.\n\nThe Turkish coast guard issued its own statement Wednesday regarding a distress call 45 miles southwest of the Turkish coastal town of Datca. The statement said the coast guard sent three vessels to the area and rescued 18 migrants from a commercial ship, as well as one Turkish national who it said had been trying to leave Turkey. They were transferred to the Turkish port of Bodrum.\n\nThe Turkish coast guard statement did not mention the island of Halki or the Greek coast guard allegations, but the area it refers to suggests the incident described was the same one reported by Greece.\n\nThousands of people continue to make their way clandestinely to the Greek islands from the nearby Turkish coast, paying smugglers to ferry them in often unseaworthy, overcrowded inflatable dinghies or other vessels.\n\nThe Greek coast guard said smuggling gangs have recently begun using larger vessels, mainly sailboats and yachts, to ferry migrants from the Turkish coast directly to southern Italy. Such a route would mean the migrants would bypass Greece, where thousands languish in overcrowded camps instead of being able to head to their intended destination, usually more prosperous European countries further north.\n\nAt least 25 such incidents have occurred in the last three months, the coast guard said, adding that they had been handled by the Greek and the Italian coast guards.\n\n\u201cTurkish authorities have been repeatedly informed about this particular phenomenon, without any response,\u201d it said.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/europe/2020/08/26/greece-rescues-96-from-sinking-yacht-smuggling-illegal-migrants-to-europe/", "published": "2020-08-26T00:00:00"}, {"title": "Labour MP Calls Brexit Supporters \u2018Absolute Sh*tbag Racist W*nkers\u2019", "text": "In a late-night tweet, Labour MP Neil Coyle accused Brexiteers of being \u201cabsolute sh*tbag racist w*nkers\u201d, in the ongoing row over the BBC\u2019s decision to pull the lyrics of Rule, Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory from this year\u2019s Last Night of the Proms.\n\nIn the now-deleted tweet, the MP for Bermondsey and Old Southwark wrote: \u201cI have spent years warning local people that these fat old racists won\u2019t stop blaming the EU when their sh*t hits the fan.

Gomez Villarreal, a former Tamaulipas police officer, is one of the top leaders within the Cartel Del Noreste faction of Los Zetas.

That crash took place one day after the ambush attack. Breitbart Texas consulted with federal law enforcement sources who revealed that at the time of the crash, authorities found road spikes.\n\nThe Mexican federal law enforcement source revealed that months prior to her arrest, La Teniente began to lose power and influence within the CDN as evidenced by her cartel\u2019s lacking response to her capture. In previous arrest operations targeting the CDN, armored cartel convoys clashed with authorities as a matter of retaliation.

If corporations are allowed to continue sending billions of dollars to \u201csocial justice\u201d campaigns, the cultural revolution will continue.\n\nRepublicans must target not just corporate donations to parties, PACs, and political candidates, but also impose regulations on the ever-broadening field of \u201cCorporate Social Responsibility,\u201d the banner under which most corporate wokeness operates.\n\nDemocrats were once the party that opposed corporate dominance in politics. Republicans must seize that mantle.\n\nRepublicans must also tackle the question of corporate racism.

Breitbart News exclusively such activities occurring at one of the largest and most powerful PR firms in the world, Publicis Groupe.\n\nQuestions need to be asked: why aren\u2019t these companies facing lawsuits for their open racism? Does the existing framework of Civil Rights law only protect some races from discrimination and not others? Does the law need to be changed?\n\nWhen there is a serious risk of more class-action lawsuits like the Damore case against Google, in which former employees sued the company for discrimination against whites, males, and Asians, corporate America will get the message.\n\nDemocrats have abandoned the principles of equality before the law and freedom from discrimination, two values with enduring appeal to Americans of every race and background. Here again is an opportunity for Republicans.\n\nIn truth, with polls consistently showing widespread public opposition to racist leftist policies like affirmative action, it has been an opportunity for some time \u2014 Republican leaders have just been too cowardly or too indoctrinated by elite higher education institutions to seize it. They need to stiffen their spines.\n\nThanks to Trump, opposition \u201ccancel culture\u201d has become a major talking point among Republicans. Even neocons like Nikki Haley are talking about it.

China is ground zero for cyberwarfare, waging relentless hacking attacks against the rest of the planet and stealing trillions of dollars of intellectual property.\n\nBeijing\u2019s latest cyberattacks included massive campaigns against the Taiwanese government and its semiconductor industry. In the United States, indictments have been filed against a string of alleged Chinese agents who stole valuable government, academic, and corporate data.\n\nWith the heat turned up against Chinese espionage, the Communist Party is using its media apparatus to paint the United States as the real menace in cyberspace. The Global Times even managed to loop Taiwan into the great cyber-conspiracy against poor, innocent Beijing:\n\nIn 2019 alone, there were three major cyberattacks related to the US. In March 2019, Venezuela\u2019s national power grid collapsed. The country\u2019s president denounced the attack as a well planned cyberattack by the US. This indicates that cyberwarfare has become a new mode of undeclared warfare \u2013 an invisible invasion of sorts. In June 2019, Trump announced retaliation against Iran with a cyberattack too. This showed that cyberwarfare has moved from the backstage to the front lines, from covert warfare to a declaration of war, and from auxiliary fighting to mainstream combat. On November 4, 2019, the US invited a number of countries to hold the first ever joint cyberattack and defense exercise with the island of Taiwan. It undertook cyberattack scenarios as a new approach to go beyond beach landings and targeting financial systems. It focused on persistent and chaotic destructive attacks on key infrastructure and economic systems. This indicates that the US has crossed the bottom line of the one-China principle in cyberspace.\n\nThis was topped off by repeating some unsubstantiated rumors that U.S. and Israeli intelligence were behind the rash of early summer fires in Iran.\n\nThe Global Times paradoxically accused the U.S. of trying to \u201cdisconnect\u201d China from the Internet and shooting itself in the foot by sabotaging its own cyber-espionage plans by disconnecting China.\n\nEven though disconnection would theoretically make China safer from those hypothetical American gremlins, the Global Times took the possibility as a signal for China to step up its \u201cdeterrence\u201d efforts against virtual warfare, including its nuclear deterrence.\n\n\u201cChina not only needs to be capable of launching counterattacks in cyberspace, but also must consider special situations in which other countries\u2019 cyberattacks might affect our ability of a nuclear counterattack. We must keep nuclear deterrence to the cyberattacks that aim to paralyze our network,\u201d the article concluded, favorably citing Russia\u2019s defense doctrine, which threatens to respond with nuclear war if a cyberattack targeting its nuclear forces is detected.\n\nLeaving the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s saber-rattling aside, the question of deterrence is an interesting aspect of computer security. For decades, security analysts have wondered what could dissuade China, North Korea, Russia, and other bad actors from their relentless campaigns of theft and espionage. Many have hotly debated the practical and ethical considerations of drawing a line in the electronic sand and threatening real-world consequences for online mischief.\n\nIn theory, hacker attacks on vital infrastructure could be as destructive and deadly as terrorist bombings. The Global Times crafted its propaganda after U.S. and NATO concerns about hyperwar: the chilling and increasingly plausible theory that the next great war will be fought in physical and virtual space simultaneously, at blinding speed, making first-strike hacker attacks every bit as provocative and dangerous as first-strike missile attacks.", "link": "http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2020/08/25/chinese-state-media-u-s-cyber-criminals-might-target-our-nuclear-arsenal/", "published": "2020-08-25T00:00:00"}, {"title": "UC Berkeley Announces $24 Million Donation to Help \u2018Historically Marginalized\u2019 Students", "text": "UC Berkeley announced this week that it has accepted a $24 million donation from the former chairman of Levi Strauss & Co. that will be earmarked to cover tuition costs for students from low-income families.
