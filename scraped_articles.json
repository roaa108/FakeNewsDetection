So if you add that additional marker for completion, they will read something into it and it tends to be a falling intonation or negative tone.\u201d\n\n\n\nMath? Whatever. It\u2019s a sine of things to come. TikTok girl\u2019s thoughts on math prove the theory that civilization is already dead. From British Museum to Mr. Bean, what made us civilized is being torn down (and we\u2019re not talking about statues).\n\nProfessor David Crystal says that the period is perceived as \u201cominous\u201d by younger people, particularly because the use of text messaging means that the end of sentences are becoming a thing of the past. Each one now has its own text message.\n\nThe professor claims that the full stop is no longer the end of a sentence, but is now an \u201cemotion marker.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look at the internet or any instant messaging exchange \u2013 anything that is a fast dialogue taking place. People simply do not put full stops in, unless they want to make a point.\u201d Crystal noted in his 2015 book Making a Point.\n\nCrystal points to a 2015 Binghamton University study that found college students perceive text messages ending in a full stop as being \u201cless sincere\u201d than those missing one.\n\nDuring the same study, researchers discovered that exclamation points had the opposite effect, making people seem more \u2018sincere and engaged\u2019.\n\nResearch leader Celia Klin noted in 2015 that \u201cWhen speaking, people easily convey social and emotional information with eye gaze, facial expressions, tone of voice, pauses and so on. People obviously can\u2019t use these mechanisms when they are texting. Thus, it makes sense that texters rely on what they have available to them \u2013 emoticons, deliberate misspellings that mimic speech sounds and, according to our data, punctuation.\u201d\n\nThe gradual erosion of Language was predicted by George Orwell in his classic dystopia 1984.\n\nIn the novel, the all powerful Party mandates Newspeak, which focuses on diminishing vocabulary in order to control the range of thought among the general population.\n\nThe Everyday Essentials Sale is now live!
